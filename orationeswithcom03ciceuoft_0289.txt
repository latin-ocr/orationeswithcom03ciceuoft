OAP. 32. ‘275

sunt3 ad Globulum delata non sunt? Ad senatum nostrum, me
consule, nonne legati Apollonidenses onmia postulata de injuriis
unius Deciani detulerunt? At haec praedia in censum dedi-
cavisti. Mitto, quod aliena; mitto, quod possessa per vim3
mitto, quod convicta ab Apollonidensibus3 mitto, quod a Perga-
menis repudiata: mitto etiam, quod a nostris magistratibus in
integrum restituta: mitto, quod nullo jure, neque in re neque in

possessione tua.

postulata] The claims, demands, or peti-
tions of the Provinciales were called their
Postulata‚ and it was usual to present them
to the Senate through one of the consuls
(Vol. I. Verr. ii. 2. c. 59).

censum declicaristi] This word occurs in
the same sense in the speech of Scipio Afri-
canus— Minor against Ti. Asellius, of which
Gellius (vii. ll) has preserved a fragment :
66 Sed tuin uno scorto majorem pecuniam
absumpsisti quam quanti omne instrumen-
tum fundi Sabini in censum dedicavisti.''
So we learn from these two passages that
6 in censum dedicare’ is to give in a return
of property for the census. In the con]-
mon texts the reading is 6 in censu.' 6 In
censum ' is Lipsius’ correction.

convicta] He says that the ‘praedia’
were 6 convicta) He means that the people
of Apollonis unanimously denounced his
knavery, and that the ‘ praedia’ were taken
from him. The words ‘in integrum resti-
tuta ' are the general form of expression to
signify that a man is restored by a decree
of a court to his former legal condition.
Here Cicero applies the words to the land;
but all this passage (see c. 31, note) is fullos
errors and obscurity. Cicero is alluding to
the decision of P. Orbius (c. 31), “ P.
Orbius . . . contra te omnia decrevit.”

neque in re neque in] Baiter follows
Mommsen, and omits the prepositions. It
is easy to give to the words the meaning
which Klotz does: ‘⁴ without any right
either in respect to property (re) or posses-
sion (possessione).'’ He had not ‘posses-
si0n‚' as Cicero says, and he had no ‘res‚’
which we can interpret, as Klotz does, by
considering property or title to possess as
opposed to bare possession. But we cannot
be sure what is meant. Ulpian (Frag. xxvi.
7) says: “ neque pater ad quem lege here—
ditas bonorumve possessio cum re pertinet.”
When the ‘bonorum possessio ¹ was given
6 cum re,’ it meant that the person obtained
the property, the ownership.

2, p. 203, on the Roman Census, and the
passages to which he refers. 6 Censui cen-
sendo ' was a technical form: “ censui cen-
sendo agri proprie appellantur qui et emi et
venire jure civili possunt” (Paulus Diac. p.
58). The act of making the return to the
consors is ‘censere' or ‘censeri3’ for both
forms were used. The censor was also said
6 censere.’ The Roman census dates from
the reign of king Servius Tullius, from
which time the chief revenue of the Roman
State consisted in a ‘ti-ibutum,’ or a tax
paid by the Roman citizens and levied on
the capital value of property, and of course
chiefly on land, which was in the early times
of Roman history the most valuable pro-
perty. The ‘tributum ' was in fact a land
tax, and the amount of the taxable property
was ascertained by the Census of Servius
Tullius. After the close of the Macedonian
war Italy was released from the 6 tributum,'
and it was never renewed, permanently at
least, till a late period in the Empire. Pro-
vincial land was subject to the payment of
the ‘vectigal' (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3. c. 6); and
Provincial land could not be entered in the
Roman census unless it had received the
Jus Italicum, the quality of Italian land,
with all the legal consequences of that qua-
lity. Italian land was a Res mancipi, the
ownership of which was transferred by a
peculiar form. We know no more of all
this affair of Decianus than Cicero tells us,
and we can never trust him in such matters.
“ Yon ran the risk‚” says Cicero, ⁴·if any
great difficulty befel the state, of having to
pay a 6 tributum ' out of the same land both
at Apollonis and at Rome.’' It is supposed
by some writers that the Italian ‘tributum'
was renewcd in the consulship of Hirtius
and Pansa, at a time when the Triumviri
were seeking to raise money by all means.
If it was established at that time, it was
certainly not continued. Cicero supposes
that a necessity might arise for again im-
posing the ‘ tributum ’ on Italia, and in that
case, if the Asiatic land of Decianus was
properly entered in the Roman census, he
might have to pay taxes for it at Rome, and
