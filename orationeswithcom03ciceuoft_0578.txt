ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

Facit apertissime contra

legem: facit is qui neque elabi ex judicio jucunditate sua neque
emitti gratia potest neque opibus et potentia leges ac judicia per-
fringere) Quae res hominem impellit ut sit tam intemperans ista

nimia gloriae cupiditate?

Familiam gladiatoriam, credo, nactus

est speciosam, nobilem, gloriosam: norat studia populi, videbat

clamores et concursus futuros.

Hac exspectatione elatus homo

flagrans cupiditate gloriae tenere se non potuit quin eos gladiatores

induceret, quorum esset ipse pulcherrimus.

him, with the remark that the Scholiast,
who has just been quoted, did not find these
words in his copy, and this seems to be so.
In the In Vatin. c.. 15, we find “quum
mea lex dilucide vetet biennio quo quis
petat petiturusve sit gladiatores dare, nisi
ex testamento praestituta die.” The text
cannot be right both in the Pro Sestio and
in the In Vatin. c. 153 and accordingly
Pantagathus proposed to change ‘ petierit ’
here into ⁴ petat‚' which alteration makes
the two passages the same, but by no means
removes the difficulty, for in neither pas-
sage are the direct words of the Lex quoted.
The formula ‘fecit. fecerit’ in a Roman
Lex often occurs, and in such cases ¹ fece-
rit’ is said to be the future perfect. “ Here
indeed‚'' says Madvig, “where the Lex
limits a time within which something must
not be done, the perfect is faulty, unless we
can suppose,'’ to use his own expression,
‘⁴ Ciceronem biennio post petitionem gla-
diatores dari sua lege vetuisse. At quid id
ad ambitum et vim ex petitione tollendam
pertinebat? aut quis putat ea lege magis-
tratus, imo ipsos aediles a gladiatoribus
dandis exclusos esse? Falsum est igitur
petierit et ejicienda petierit aut, addita· ab
aliquo, qui locum similem Vatinianae loco
facere voluit..'’ This argument is not satis-
factory. If ⁴ petierit ' must refer to ‘ post
petitionem,' the provision is just the same
as one in the English Treating Act (Pro
Murena, c. 34, note). Wesenberg agrees
with Madvig. Bake thinks that ‘petierit
aut' should not be erased, and that we
could do without the ‘aut petiturus sit,'
better than without the ‘ petierit 3’ in which
Halm agrees with him. Halm thinks that
‘petierit' is the subjunctive of the ‘futu-
rum exactum,’ and we may suppose the
formula of the Lex to be after this fashion :
‘⁴ biennio (which is properly, within the two
years of the canvass3 in fact, the same as
⁴ biennio ante ') quo quis petet aut- petitu-
rus erit, ne gladiatores dato.'' Cicero, quot-

ing these words in the indirect form os
expression in the oration Pro Vatinio, used
‘ petat ‘ for ⁴ petet ' for this reason: “ quo-
niam legitimae formae petiturus sit propter
alteram disjunctionis partem singularem
locus non erat: in or. autem Sestiana
minus accurate ex futuro pelet conjuncti-
vum futuri exacti petierit formavit, eo
fortasse inductus, quod ejus temporis usus
in legum formulis frequentissimus erat.'’
This is judicious, even if it is not the true
explanation. Cicero does not in either
passage give the exact words of the Lex.
He quotes them indirectly, and whenever
the words ofa statute are so quoted, it is
certain that some discrepancy in tenses will
arise. ‘ Aut petierit‚' which has raised all
this pothcr‚ is, Ι think, more certainly a
genuine expression of Cicero than ‘ petitu-
rus sit‚' or at least as certain. We must
translate the text according to its plain
meaning3 which is this: ‘within two years
of a rnan's canvass3’ the exact meaning
of which words Ι leave others to explain
as they please.

jucunditate sna] ‘ Because he is liked '
for his character and pleasant manners.
Halm compares Q. Cicero, De Pet. Cons.
c. 5: ‘⁴ Amicorum studia beneficiis et offi-
ciis et vetustate et facilitate ac jucunditate
naturae parta esse oportet ;” and Garatoni
compares Ad Fam. ix. 15 : ‘⁴ Quod tu ipse
tam amandus es tamque dulcis tamque
omni in genere jucundus, id est proprium
tuum.”

ista nimia qloriae cupiditate .7] This is
the common reading. But P. has ‘iste
nimia‚’ and G. ‘iste animia.' Madvig
says that ‘ista' should be ‘illa‚’ and he
has other objections. He concludes that
the words are a gloss. Halm (2) has
‘intemperans?—Est enim nimia gloriae cu-
piditate.—,’ the conjecture of Ieep.

that might have been some excuse3 but he
ought not to have felt any great desire to
