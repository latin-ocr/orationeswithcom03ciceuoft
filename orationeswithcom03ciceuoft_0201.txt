CAP. 19, 20. 187

conjunctione agebantur—an in tantis rebus, tam novis consiliis,
tam periculosis, tam turbulentis, hominem amantissimum sui, fami-
liarissimum, conjunctissimum officiis, usn, consuetudine, dimitten-

rebus, quem in otio semper secum habuisset, hunc in adversis et in
eo tumultu, quem ipse comparabat, ab se dimitteret. Ipse autem
Sittius, non enim mihi deserenda est caussa amici veteris atque
hospitis, is homo est aut ea familia ac disciplina ut hoc credi possit,
eum bellum rei publicae facere voluisse? ut, cujus pater, quum
ceteri deficerent finitimi ac vicini, singulari exstiterit in rem publi-
cam nostram officio et fide, is sibi nefarium bellum contra patriam
suscipiendum putaret? cujus aes alienum videmus, judices, non
libidine, sed negotii gerendi studio esse contractum, qui ita Romae

and Cicero tell us, and we must be content
with that. Catilina would be very ready
to exaggerate his means in order to encou-
rage his partizans, and if 110 said that Sittius
was in Spain or in Mauritania on his busi-
ness, that does not prove the fact-3 nor

trusted3 and we cannot trust him here,
where he wishes to make Sulla’s friend Sit-
tius a merchant adventui-er. The short
story of Appian, who often laid hold of plain
facts, tells us that he carried men to Mau-
ritania, and helped the African princes

does Sallust (Cat. 21) affirm it to be true.

arhitrabalm·?] T. B. have ‘arbitraba-
tur,' which Halm prints. He makes ‘At
haec ipsa . . . agebantur¹ a distinct sentence.
It looks like a parenthetical sentence. The
other reading is ¹ arbitraretur!

Veri simile non θεὴ] Lambinus erases
these words with a curse on the half-learned
who spoil what they do not understand.
These words, he says, come from their
workshop, and he cites two like instances:
“ verisimile non est ut . . . anteponeret ”
(Verr. ii. 4, 0. 6, Vol. I.); and “non est
verisimile ut . . . adamarit.” Halm explains
the ‘ ut ' after ‘ veri simile non est' thus:
he says that the thought ⁴ vix fieri potuit ut'
lies at the bottom of the form of speech.

bellum reipublicae] ‘bellum populo Ro-
man0,’ Halm.

ceteri deficerent] In the Social war.
He was from Nuceria in Campania.

ueqolii yerendz' studio] Cicero says that
110 bon-owed money to carry on his African
spcculations, or to make some contract
with the Mauritanian king. He says, or hc
leaves us to infer, that it was simply a mer-
cantile speculation. But if Sittius raised
111011 111 Spain and Italy, 110 would want
money sor that purpose. Ciccro’s history,
as I have often observed, can never be

against 0110 another. This fact and his
subsequent career make it probable that
110 was like the commanders of the Free
Companies‚ who sold their services to the
Italian towns or princes in the troubled
times of modern Italian history, where we
find an English adventuren Hawkwood,
playing a great part as a Condottiere. The
subsequent history of Sittius justifies all
that we may conjecture about him from the
evidence that has been mentioned. When
Caesar landed in Africa 111 Β.0. 46, Sittius
had 3 fleet and an army with which he
joined Caesar, to whom he was very useful
in his African war. Caesar rewarded him
with a part of Numidia, a part of Massi—
nissa’s kingdom, where Sittius settled with
his men, and became an African prince.
Sittius afterwards lost his life through the
treachery of Arabio, Massinissa’s son.
Cicero speaks of Sittius’ death in a letter
to Atticus (xv. l7): “Arabioni de Sittio
nihil irascorff’ This was the way he spokc
of his old friend, the merchant adventurm,
the honour-able man.

quidquam oneris] A procurator reprc—
sented liis absent principal in all respects,
and was personally responsible (Pro I’.
Quintio, c. 7). The form ⁴ ita Romae de-
buit ut' has been explained several times :
