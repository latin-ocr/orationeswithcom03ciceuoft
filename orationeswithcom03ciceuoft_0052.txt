38 ORAT. ΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

nepos, quis adulter, quae mulier infamis, quis corruptor juventutis,
quis corruptus, quis perditus inveniri potest qui se cum Catilina
non familiarissime vixisse fateatur? Quae caedes per hosce annos
sine illo facta est; quod nefarium stuprum non per illum& dam
vero quae tanta umquam in ullo homine juventutis illecebra fuit
quanta in illo? qui alios ipse amabat turpissime, aliorum amori
flagitiosissime serviebat3 aliis fructum libidinum, aliis mortem
parentum non modo impellendo verum etiam adjuvando pollicebatur.
Nunc vero quarn subito, non solum ex urbe, verum etiam ex agris
ingentem numerum perditorum hominum collegerat. Nemo non
modo Romae, sed ne ullo in angulo totius Italiae oppressus aere
alieno fuit, quein non ad hoc incredibile sceleris foedus asciverit.
V. Atque ut ejus diversa studia in dissimili ratione perspicere
possitis, nemo est in ludo gladiatorio paullo ad facinus audacior qui
se non intimum Catilinae esse fateatur⁷ nemo in scena levior et

not tell how much we should believe; but

“Not to mention Rome (non modo), but
Plutarch’s story (Cicero, c. 10) ot' his living

in any corner of all Italy there was not a

in incestuous commerce with his daughter
requires more evidence than common report.

Jam vero—illecebra] We are curious to
know the real character of a man who con-
ceived the design of this revolution which
threatened Rome. Cicero allows that he
had great talents (In Cat. iii. 7); and in a
passage quoted by Halm from the oration
Pro Caelio (c. 6), which was written later
than this, he gives him credit for some
good qualities and great versatility of ta-
lent. lt is difficult to say what Catilina’s
character really was, for his euemies pro-
bably exaggerated his vices and said as
little as they could of his virtues, if he had
any. lIe had at least some qualities which
a brave and a good man ought to have. All
that (Jieero says about Catilina 111 the ora-
tion Pro Caelio (c. 4, &‹¹.) is worth reading.

ne ullo in anqulo] Halm has ‘ nc ullo
quidem in angulo,' the reading of one MS.
But ‘ nc ullo 111 angulo' is the reading of
his other MSS. One MS. has ‘nullo in
angulo! ‘Nec ullo 111 angulo,⁷ which is
printed in some editions, is the reading of
Lambinus, aud I do not know if there
is any MSS. authority for it. Th. Momm-
sen would read ⁴ sed ullo 111 angulos The
negativos 111 Latin and iu all lauguages
are a great. difficulty. lf logieal aeeuraey
were a sate guido, we might determine
when they should be used aud when they
should not·; but custom has iu many cases
settled the. matter, contrary to what. it ought
to be. Mommsen is right. so far as the
sense is concerned, for Cicero says this:

person (nemo—fuit) loaded with debt,
whom he did not associate in this incredible
league of crime.’' But probably the Ro-
man formula requires ‘ne ullo quidem 111
angulo.'

5. diversa studia] ‘Diversa' literally
means turned in contrary directions, and
we may accordingly translate ⁴ diversa stu-
dia’ by ‘opposite pursuitsff He adds ‘in
dissimili ratione.' Such forms of expres·
sion are very difficult to translate. Halm
translates it: ‘widerstrebende Neigungen
in verschiedenartiger Richtung (Bereiche).’
But this is no translation of ‘in dissimili
ratione.' Cic-ero means that Catilina's ener-
gies were turned in opposite directions, as
the objects to which he directed them were
different. The translation of Latin otten
fails, because we attempt to keep a form of
expression which is entirely ditl'crent from
any thing that we have.

asasefnleatur] These words are wanting
in three MSS. (Halm.) lf they were omit-
ted ‘fuisse commemoret' would belong to
both members of the. sentence. and the
change from ‘ esse fateatur ' to ‘sitisse com—
memoret’ would bc avoided. ssut Cicero
may have choseu to express himself as it
stands 111 the text. Halm observes that
‘ sodalis' is more thau ‘ intimus! A pas-
sage is quoted t'rom Q. (fit-ero, De Petitioue
consulatus, e. 3, where he says ot‘ Catilina:
“qui postea eum histrionibus et eum gla-
diatoribus ita vixit. ut alteros libidinis, alte-
ros facinorum adjutores haberet.”

in scena] Actora were Infames.
