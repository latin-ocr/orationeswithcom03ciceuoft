OAP. 17, 18. ist}

At accusat C. Cornelii filius, idemque valere debet ac si pater
indicaret. Ο patrem Cornelium sapientem, qui quod praemii solet
csse in indicio reliquerit; quod turpitudinis in confessione, id per
accusationem filii susceperit. Sed quid est tandem quod indicat
per istum puerum Cornelius? Si est caussa mihi ignota, cum
Hortensio communicata, respondeat Hortensius. Sin, ut ais, illum
conatum Autronii et Catilinae, quum in campo, consularibus co-
mitiis quae a me habita sunt, caedem facere voluerunt, Autronium
tum in campo vidimus3 et quid dixi, vidisse nos? Ego vidi—vos
enim tum, judices, nihil laborabatis neque suspicabamini; ego
tectus praesidio firmo amicorum Catilinae tum et Autronii copias
et conatum repressi—Num quis est igitur qui tum dicat in cam-
pum aspirasse Sullam? Atqui si tum se cum Catilina societate
sceleris conjunxerat, cur ab eo discedebat? 0111· cum Autronio non
erat? cur inpari caussa non paria signa criminis reperiuntur?
Sed quoniam Cornelius ipse etiam nunc de indicando dubitat, ut
dicitis, informat adhuc adumbratum indicium filii, quid tandem de

quentibus‚’ as Halm says (Auet. ad Herenn.
ii. c. 5). Halm has this remark: ‘⁴ 1Υο see
how weak the defence is, which rcsts merely
on two assertions: 1, I did not see Sulla at

C. Cornelius] The son was Torquatus’
‘ subscriptor.’ The father, a Roman eques,
was implicated in the conspiracy (Sallust,
Cat. c. 28). He and Vargunteius under-

took to murder Cicero. The words ¹ prae-
mii solet esse' are explained by the passage
in In Cat. iv. c. 3, note ou ⁶ praemia.’
Cornelius exposed his own disgrace, 110 ad-
mitted his own villany by making his son
his instrument in attacking Sulla. Cicero
calls young Cornelius ¹puer,' but we cannot
tell what his age was. He was no doubt a
young man. This ‘ puer ' is here a term of
contempt. Cicero called Octavianus a
‘ puer’ (Ad Fam. xii. 25, and Phil. iv. l),
where he is not speaking coutemptuously,
as Tischer, quoted by Halm, observes.

St est caussa] ‘⁴ Si vetera, mihi ignota
. . . respondit Hortensius‚” Halm. T. has
⁴ si vetera 3' Β. has ‘sin ea.' The rest have
‘ si est causa.’ T. has ‘respondit ς’ S. and
4 Oxonn. have ‘ respondet.’ It is doubtful
what B. has.

illum conatum] T. has ‘conatum‚' which
Halm has taken, and Ι have no doubt that
it is the true reading. The word ‘conatum'
dcpends on ‘indicat.’ The other reading is
‘ comitatum.'-—‘ ct quid :’ ‘ sed quid,’ Halm.

aspirasse] Cicero often 11505 this word.
lt is not a metaphor which we can admirc.
Hc says Pro P. Quintio, c. 29, ⁴ Dixi Romae
domum fnisse quoistc ne aspirarit quidemst
⁴ which hc never made even an effort to
rem-h! See also Verr. ii. 2. c. 151, note.

cnr ab eo, δια] The proos ‘ cx conse-

that time in the Campus Martius; 2, he
was never seen together with Catilina in
the time immediately following.'’ But the
weakness is in the critic. The guilt of
Sulla must be proved by positive evidence;
and so far as this oration tells us, there was
none. There was affirmation without evi-
dence, to which it is never necessary to give
an answer; and there might be facts, on
which a certain amount of presumption or
suspicion might be founded, but not pre-
sumption enough to be taken as evidence
in a criminal tria13 and as for what is called
suspicion. that is not a matter that belongs
to legal inquiry any further than as the
means of inducing search. Suspicion is
extrajudicial entirely3 and a juryman who
allows suspicion to affect his verdict, 01· a
judge who says that he has certain suspi-
cions, is, to use plain language‚ as unfit for
his function as a sool. But Cicero wished
to remove even suspicion from the minds
of the judices, Ile says he did not see
Sulla in the Campus, and we assume that
he means that nobody else saw hini. Nor
was Sulla afterwards scon in Catilina's coni-
pany. The conclusion is that the prosecu-
tor could not deny either of these assei-timis.

adhuc] Ernesti. llalin has ⁴ ad hoc

bratum’ is au outline dctermincd by a
