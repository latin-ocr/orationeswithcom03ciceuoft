was one ofthe privileges of a Roman citizen,
It was the capacity to make a will οι·
codicss, to be instituted ‘heres,’ or made a
⁴ legatarius ' and to be a witness to a will
(Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 3. c. 40, note on Commer-
cium). Halm says that ⁴ sa'epe' is a rheto-
rical exaggeration; but that there was a
foundation for it. in the fact of Archias hav—
ing accompanied Lucullus in his campaigns.
Ι suppose he means that as his life was in-
secure, or he might chance to lose it, he
was every now and then making his last
will, like Caesar’s men when they were going
to fight the German king (Β. G. i. 39).
Klotz observes that Cicero’s ‘ saepe ' means
no more than once or twice. This talk
about wills made in the campaign seems to
be the suggestion of Ballhorn-Rosen‚ which
Klotz calls an unlucky one, and so it is.
Rosen supposes that the ⁴ testamenta in pro-
cinctu' were meant, the testaments made
in presence of the enemy. Klotz correctly
remarks that they were now out of fashion.
¹(See the note in Long’s Caesar, Β. G. i.

iit benficiis] His name was returned by
L. Lucullus to the treasury (aerarium)
among those who deserved some reward for
their services, or among those whom he had
rewardedin some way. Cicero (Ad Fam. v.
20) has a passage on the ‘iu beneficiis’
which is instructive: ‘⁴ quod scribis de be-
neficiis, scito a me et tribunos militares et
praefectos et contubernales dumtaxat meos
delatos esse. In quo quidem me ratio
fefellit: liberum enim mihi tempus ad cos
deferendos existimabam dari3 postea certior
sum factus triginta diebus deferri necesse
esse quihus rationes detulissem.'’

6. convicio] This word here means
‘noisess the clamour ‘causidicorum‚’ the
bawling of the noisy word-splitters. Grae-

vius quotes a passage of Phaedrus (i. 2):

“ Clamorem ranae sustulere ad sidera.
Convicio permotus Juppiter.''

Halm writes ⁴ convitio ' here and elsewhere ;
but Baiter does not.

litteris] The orator has now got a
subject that he likes: he is talking of him-
self. He could however talk well, and say
something worth hearing, which is not
always the case with great talkers. ‘⁵ Let
the men be ashamed who have so buried
themselves in letters that they are unable
to get out of them any profit for common
use, or produce any thing before men's eyes
and the light of day.'' Those who are
buried in letters cannot be accused now-a-
days of svnding out nothing; they are con-
tinually sending something, but what many
do send is most wonderful. This is an in-
tem perance in literature, as Seneca aptly calls
it (Ep. 106), as bad in its kind as any other
intemperance. It fills the world with use-
less books. But the world has its revenge.
It does not read them.

Cicero was always working, and he has
produced something for men to look at,
something that will bear the light. His
vanity has let us know more about him than
we should have known, if he had been a
modest man. He says truly of himself
(Phil. ii. c. 8). ‘tantum dicam breviter

. . me nec reipublicae nec amicis un-
quam defuisse et tamen omni genere monu-
mentorum meorum perfecisse operis subse—
civis, ut meae vigiliae meaeque litterae et
juventuti utilitatis et nomini Romano laudis
aliquid afferrent.”

The Romans also said ⁴ se in litteras ab-
dere‚' and ‘litteris se involvere ;' no bad
kind of expression.
