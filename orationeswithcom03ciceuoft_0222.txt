208 INTRODUOTION.

me3 and yet 116 says in this oration that Archias had begun the poem
(c. 11). He adds that he is afraid that Archias was employed upon a
Caeciliana Fabula, something perhaps that related to the Gens Caecilia.
However Cicero made up for Archias' omission by writing the history
of his consulship in Greek prose; and he was so vain as to think that
nobody could venture to handle the same subject after him (Ad Att.
1. 20).

So far as we can juclge from what the orator says there was no diffi-
culty in proving Archias’ title3 and Cicero accordingly devoted the
larger part of this short speech to the praise of poetry and of learned
men. It seems likely that when he published this oration he left out
all the more formal part and elaborated the introduction and the perora-
tion as a kind of rhetorical exercise.

Halm says that the poet gained his cause, but Ι know no ancient
writer who says so. However the cause has preserved Archias’ name.
His works are lost, but perhaps it is 110 loss to us. He wrote a poem
on the Cimbrian war of C. Marius3 and another poem on the Mithri-
datic war and his patron L. Lucullus. He wrote something, perhaps an
Epigram, 011 1116 actor Q. Roscius, who, as the story goes, when he was
a child and lying in his cradle, was found by his nurse encircled in the
folds of a serpent. This memorable incident, which was interpreted as
a sign of his future fame, was commemorated by the artist Pasiteles in
silver and by Archias in some verses (De Divin. i. c. 36). There, are
several Epigrams in the Anthology which bear the name of Archias, but
none of them is assigned to the poet of Antioch.

Some critics have disputed the genuineness of this speech ; but there is
no evidence either external or internal against its being the work of
Cicero. Tacitus, or the author of the De Oratoribus (c. 37), speaks of
an oration for Licinius Archias by Cicero, and he remarks that it is not
one of those on which the oratorical reputation of Cicero is founded.
