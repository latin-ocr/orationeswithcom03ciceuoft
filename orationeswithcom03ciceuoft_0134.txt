120 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

etiam sine ulla aperta caussa fit aliud aqtue existimaris, nt non-
numquam ita factum esse etiam populus admiretur; quasi vero
non ipse fecerit. Nihil est incertius vulgo, nihil obscurius volun-
tate hominum, nihil fallacius ratione tota comitiorum. Quis L.
Philippum summo ingenio, opera, gratia, nobilitate, a M. Herennio
superari posse arbitratus est? quis Q. Catulum, humanitate, sapien-
tia, integritate antecellentem, a Cn. Mallio? quis M. Scaurum,
hominem gravissimum, civem egregium, fortissimum senatorem, a
Q. Maximo? Non modo horum nihil ita fore putatum est, sed ne
quum esset factum quidem quare ita factum esset intelligi potuit.
Nam ut tempestates saepe certo aliquo caeli signo commoventur,
saepe improviso nulla ex certa ratione, obscura aliqua ex caussa
concitantur, sic in hac comitiorum tempestate populari saepe intel-
ligas quo signo commota sit; saepe ita obscura est ut casu exci-
tata esse videatur. XVIII. Sed tamen, si est reddenda ratio,
dnae res veliementer in praetura desideratae sunt, quae ambae in
consulatu Murenae profuerunt: una, exspectatio muneris, quae et

L. Philippum] He was consul with S.
Julius Caesar in 13.c. 91, but he had lost
his 818011011 011 3 former occasion. Q. Ca-
tulus was the eolleague of Marius B.c. 102,
and assisted in the defeat of the Cimbri and
Teutones 13.c. 101. The election of Cn.

18. duae res—desideratae] Two things
failed Murena when he was a candidate for
the praetorship, but the same two things
helped him when he was acandidate for the
consulship. One was the fact that when
Murena was a candidate for the praetorship,

Mallius and the rejection of Catulus are
mentioned in the oration Pro Plancio, 0. 5.
There is the usual discrepancy here about
the name of Mallius, which some of the
best MSS. have: others have Manilius, and
some have Manlius. Moebius in his note,
which is taken from others, says that we
must read ‘Mallio’ here, because the fa-
mily of the Manlii was renowned, but that
of the Mallii was of no note. Besides, he
says, the name Mallius appears in the
MSS„ and on a marble slab found at Pu-
teoli (Pighius, Annal. iii. p. 145), and a
similar permutation occurs in the orations
against Catilina (In Cat. i. 3). This Man-
lius, or Manilius, or Mallius was consul in
B.c. 105 with P. Rutilius Rufus. The prae-
nomen of this man as well as his gentile
name is uncertain (Clinton, Fasti, 13.c. 105).
Manlius was defeated by the Cimbri (Liv.
Ep. 67), or the Galli as Sallust says (Jug.
c. 113, 114 .

Μ. Scaur)us was the father of the Scaurus
in defence of whom Cicero delivered an
oration, a fragment of which is extant.

Nam vat—excitata esse videatmu] This
passage is quoted by Quintilian (Inst. viii.
3. 80) as an example of poetic style, “jam
paene poetico spii-ituss’

the army of Lucullus, which had been the
witness of his liberality and merit in Asia,
had not returned to Rome. But the army
was present when he was a candidate for the
consulship, and he was elected and Servius
was rejected. The other thing which helped
Murena in his elec-tion for the consulship
was the ‘ munus,’ the public shows which
he gave in his praetorship.
Praetor urbanus (c. 20).

Murena was
It was the busi-
ness of the Praetor urbanus to super-intend
the celebration of the Ludi Apollinares
(Livy 27. 0. 23). But if the Ludi Apolli-
nares were regularly superintended by the
Praetor urbanus, the words ‘ expectatio mu-
neris-—creverat ' has no meaning; and it is
conjectured that the ⁴ munus ' was a show
of gladiator& or something extraordinary.
Moebius observes, that as Murena had not
been Aedilis, he could not have given any
public 51101175, and when he was a candidate
for the praetorship, he had done nothing to
please the people. It was all to come, and
it was all in expectation3 but he satisfied
the expectation in his practorship, and so
he seeured his elcetion in his eanvass for the
consulship: ‘⁶ Quod petitio praeturae desi-
derabat, praetura rcstituit.''
