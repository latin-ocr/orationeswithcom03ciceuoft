12 INTRODUOTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ

Roms, v. 506) sees still deeper into Caesar’s motives: Caesar cared
neither for the prisoners nor the Senate. He only wished to make the
aristocracy unpopular, and to appear the friend of the people, who
wanted not blood, but only protection against massacre and the destruc-
tion of their 11011505.

This speech moved the Senate. They had been told that it was
illegal to put the conspirators to death by a decree of the Senate.
Even Q. Cicero, Marcus’ brother, who was Praetor designatus, was
ala-rmed: he feared for his brother. (Sueten. Caesar, c. 14.) But the
consul was resolved to punish the conspirators. He rose and addressed
the Senate in a speech, which is entitled the Fourth Oration against
Catilina, He discussed the different opinions of Silanus and Caesar
with reference to his own persona] security‚ and the risk that he ran
of bearing all the blame of this extraordinary severity. He clearly
expresses his wish that- the Senate would adopt the proposal of Silanus
without regard to the consequences for himself. It is conjectured that
the speech which we have is not exactly the speech that was delivered,
though in substance the spoken speech may have been the same. When
he published his Four Orations against Catilina, he probably added to
them much of their rhetorical ornament. It does not appear in what
part of the (lebate he spoke 3 but it was before Tib. N ero, who proposed
to adjourn the (lebate, and in the mean time to adopt further measures
sor the security of the state; and before M. Porcius Cato. Appian
(B. G. ii. 5) says that the proposal of Nero was to keep the men in
prison till Catilina was defeated, and they had got 111010 -information
about the conspiracy. Cicero says nothing in his speech about the pro-
posal of Nero, nor about Cato, whence we may conclude that he spoke
before them. The Senator-s were still undecided after Cicero’s speech3
or rather they were in favour of Caesar’s proposa13 “ all Cicero’s friends,
thinking that Caesar’s opinion was for the advantage of Cicero, for he
would be subject to less blame if he did not condemn the men to death,
chose the second opinion rather, 50 that even Silanus himself changed

prison. After the opinion was given, Catulus Lutatius was the first to
oppose it; and 110 was followed by Cato, who in his speech vehemently
urged suspicion against Caesar, and 50 filled 1110 Senate with passion
and resolution, that they passed a vote of death against the 111011”
