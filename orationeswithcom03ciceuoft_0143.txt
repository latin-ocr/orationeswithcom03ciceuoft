GAP. 24—26. 129

corpora esse rei publicae, unum debile, infirmo capite; alterum
firmum, sine capite: huic, si ita de se meritum esset, caput se
vivo non defuturum. Congemuit senatus frequens, neque tamen
satis severe pro rei indignitate decrevit 3 nam partim ideo fortes in
decernendo non erant, quia nihil timebant, partim quia timebant:
quum erupit e senatu, triumphans gaudie, quem omnino vivum
illinc exire non oportuerat; praesertim quum idem ille in eodem
ordine paucis diebus ante Catoni, fortissimo viro, judicium minitanti
ac denuntianti, respondisset, si quod esset in suas fortunas incen-
dium excitatum, id se non aqua sed ruina restincturum. XXVI.
His tum rebus commotus, et quod homines jam tum conjuratos
cum gladiis in campum deduci a Catilina sciebam, descendi in
campum cum firmissimo praesidio fortissimorum virorum, et cum
illa lata insignique lorica, non quae me tegeret, etenim sciebam

the MSS. Lambinus is in raptures about
it: “mirabilis hic quoque et paene dicam
divina Hottomanni εὐτυχία fuit.” Cicero
(Verr. ii. ⁶2. c. 4-2) : ‘⁸ Hic videte in quot se
laqueos induerit.” Caesar (B. G. vii. 73)
says ε “ 58 ipsi vallis acutissimis induebant.”
Catilina did not clear himself, but he ex-
posed himself (indicavit) and entangled him-
self (induit).

infirmo capite:] Manutius would write
⁵ firmo capite‚⁷ in order that contraries may
ans'wer to contraries ; and he cites Plutarch’s
version of what Catilina said (Cicero, 8. 14),
which is this: “ What am I doing so strange,
if when there are two bodies, one lean and
wasted, but with a head, and the other
headless‚ but strong and large, Ι myself
furnish it with a head ?’' Sylvius thinks that
Manutius' emendation is beautiful. It is
a very easy emendation to make, and
5118810115, but it is salse. Graevius, who is
generally judicious, saw that Cicero's ver-
sion οἲ what he said was the true version.
Plutarch's version simply gives the weak
body a head3 but when we say a head, we
mean a strong head. The head was Cicero,
and Catilina meant to say that it was a
weak head.

partim—partim]
See Pro Fonteio, e. 12. Vol. II.——‘ quum
erupit ε’ ‘ atque erupit‚' Halm, following Th.
Mommsen. The MSS. have ‘que,’ ⁴qui,’
‘tum.’ If wc must change any thing, I
prefer ‘quum' to Mommsen’s ‘atque’—

called and Cicero attacked him in the first
oration, that Catilina said, ‘⁴ Quoniam qui-
dem circumventus ab inimicis praeceps agor,
incendium meum ruina restinguam.” Cicero
certainly knew the history of the conspiracy
better than Sallust; but if we are to choose
between them in this trifling matter, I do
not think we must assume that Cicero is
right and Sallust wrong. Cicero was care-
less about facts, and here he would state
such a fact as this in the way that best
suited his purpose. Catilina threatened, if
a conflagration was lighted up against his
fortunes, that he would not extinguish it by
water, which I suppose was the usual way
of pntting out a fire in a house, but by pull-
ing down others, as houses were sometimes
pulled down to stop the progress of a great
fire.

26. illa—lorica] The coat of mail is
mentioned by Plutarch (Cicero, c. 143 and
compare In Cat. i. 8. 5). This use of ⁴ illa'
is very common in Cicero. Our pronoun
‘that’ does not tell the meaning of it;
though it seems that ‘ille' in Latin bore
its meaning with it, and ‘ insigni’ makes it
still plainer.

He alludes to Catilina's assassinations.
There is a story of his carrying to L. Sulla
the head of M. Marius Gratidianus still
palpitating (Plutarch, Sulla, c. 3·.); Asco-
nius, on the oration ln Toga Candida).
Gratidianus was twice praetor, as Asconius
say-¹, and on very intimate ternis with
Civem. It seems almost incrediblc that a
man after ‹·ommitting such a crime as this
was allowed to live, to hc elected praetor,
to govern a province, and to aspire to the
consulship. But it may be truestill. Franco
