194 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

tum a vobis peto ut taciti de omnibus, quos conjurasse cognitum
est, cogitetis. Intelligetis unum quemque eorum prius ab sua vita
quam vestra suspicione esse damnatum. Ipsum illum Autronium,
quoniam ejus nomen finitimum maxime est hujus periculo et crimini,
non sua vita ac natura convicit? Semper audax, petulans, libidi-
nosus; quem in stuprorum defensionibus non solum verbis uti
improbissimis solitum esse scimus, verum etiam pugnis et calcibus 3
quem exturbare homines ex possessionibuS, caedem facere vicinorum,
spoliare fana sociorum, vi [conatum] et armis disturbare judicia, in
bonis rebus omnes contemnere, in malis pugnare contra bonos, non

rei publicae cedere, non fortunae ipsi succumbere.

Hujus si caussa

non manifestissimis rebus teneretur, tamen eum mores ipsius ac

vita convincerent.

XXVI. Agedum, conferte nunc cum illis vitam P. Sullae, vobis
populoque Romano notissimam, judices, et eam ante oculos vestros

proponite.

sua vila ac versura] I have followed
Halm in this passage, which is corrupt in
the editions. There are many readings.
Gruter says of the vulgata “non sua con-
suetudo ac vita convincit‚” that it is con-
trary to the edition of 14513 and Pall. octo,
which if he could examine well, he could
still remove many saults from Cicero. He
adds the following. which is worth knowing:
‘⁴ nunc istud moneo tantum, ne arbitrentur
homines Ciceroni nihil jam amplius addi,
nihil auferri posse: immo nullo auctore
hodiernum in diem utimur vitiosiore.'’ The
reading in the text is that of T.

in stuprormn] It might perhaps mean
when he was defending his own ‘stupra ;’
but most probably it. means when he was
defending persons who were accused of
‘ stuprum) His langnaee was foul, and he
was ready to strike and kick. Halm con-
siders this to be a rhetorical exaggeration to
indicate the violent passion of Autronius in
his action3 but I think it expresses his pas-
sionate manner generally.

‘ Stuprum,' in its narrower sense, signi-
fies commerce. wilh a widow or a maid, and
also an unnatural crime (Dig. 48. 5. 34).
But the word is usually restricted to sexual
intercourse with free u omen, either unmar-
ried or wid‹›wed; and it was ‘ stupruni'
whether {hc man was married or not (Tacit.
xiv. 2). The relation called ⁴concuhinatus,'
and the commerce with ⁴ meren·ices‚’ was
not ⁴ stuprum.y The Lex Julia de adulte-
riis is the first Lex that. we are acquaiuted

Ecquod est hujus factum aut commissum, non dicam

with which determined the character of
¹ stuprum ’ and the punishment. But this
passage of Cicero and other passages show
that there were forms of procedure in
cases of ‘stuprum‚’ and penalties, before
the enactment of the Lex Julia. An at-
tempt to corrupt the chastity of a person
was a ground of action. A case is men-
tioned in Livy (viii. 22) of a. man being
tried on the “ crimen stupratae matrisfami-
liae.'’ See also Livy x. 31.

sociorum‚] The Provinciales, for surh
was the meaning of Socii in Cicero’s time;
at least he often uses the word in this sense.
In the letter to his brother Quintus he
says (i. 1. c. l) “nullam defectionem socio-
rum,’' where the ‘socii' are the Provinciales
of the Provincia Asia.

[conatum] ] Lambinus erased the word,
which he supposed to be an interpolation.
But it is the reading of most of the MSS.
‘Conatum ' is certainly not right. Some
MSS. have ⁴ vi conatu et armis 3’ which is
feeble. Orelli supposes that we should
read “vi coactis et armatis‚’' which form of
expression has often been corrupted. But
I do not believe that this conjecture restores
the true reading.

26. cumillis] Some MSS. Halm says.
the best· have *cum illius,' where ⁶ illius’
must. refer to Autronius. Still ‘ cum illis '
gives the better meaning, for ‘ with thern ’
means ⁴ with their liseff T. has ‘cum illius
vita‚’ but as Halm observes, this does not
agree with ‘ vobis . . . notissimam.'
