and with a feeble head, the other strong, but without a head3 yet this
body, since he owed it obligations, should never want a head so long as
he lived (Plutarch, Cicero, c. 143 and compare Catilina’s answer in
Plutarch with Cicero’s version of it). The Senate, on hearing Catilina's
declaration, gave the Consuls full power to maintain the law. The
usual formula on such an occasion was: ‘Darent operam consules
ne quid Res Publica detrimenti capcret’ (Sallust, Cat. c. 29). The
Comitia were held on the twenty-eighth of October (In Cat. i. c. 3).
Cicero appeared in the Campus with a resolute body-guard, and the con-
spirators were deterred from making any disturbance. D. Junius
Silanus and L. Licinius Murena were elected consuls

A few days after, news from Faesulae came to Rome that Manlius,
with a large force, was in the field3 there were also rumours of people
meeting together, of arms being got, and that the slaves at Capua and
in Apulia were stirring. On this the Senate despatched the proconsul
Q. Marcius Rex with an army to Faesulae3 and Q. Metellus Creticus
into Apulia and the neighbouring parts. The praetor Q. Pompeius
Rufus was sent to Capua; and Q. Metellus Celer, also a praetor, was
sent into Picenum, both of them with full power to raise troops. Re-
wards were offered for information about the conspiracy3 the troops of
ghdiators, on whose aid Catilina reckoned, were distributed in Capua
and the other Italian llluiiicipia ; and a vigilant watch was kept in Rome
(Sallust, Cat. c. 30). Notice of a prosecution under the Lex Plautia
de vi was given to Catilina, who, to keep up a show of innocence, offered
to put himself in the custody of several men of rank (Cicero, In Cat. i.
6. 8). But at this time he was plotting Cicero's death. He called his
men together on the evening of the sixth of November at the house of
M. Porcius Laeca. He informed them that 116 had made all his prepa-
rations, and that he wished to go and ι10111 Manlius, if he could take off
Cicero first. Two 111611, L. Vargunteius and C. Cornelius, offered to
callen Cicero the following morning and to murder him in his own
house. Curius told Fulvia of the design, and Fulvia carried the news
to the consul. The men came to his door in the morning3 but they
were turned away. On the eighth of November Cicero summoned the
Senate to the Temple of Jupiter Stator, which he had surrounded with
Roman equites in arms. Catilina was present. The consul brokc out
in a furious invective against Catilina, exposed his treasonable plot, told
him that 116 was well informed of all that 116 had done and was doing,
and adviscd 111111 to leave Rome and go into volnntary exile. This is the
first of the four orations against Catilina, which Cicero afterwards
pnblished (‘ scriptam cdidit3⁷ Sallust, Cat. c. 2315 Ad Attic. ii. 1).
W'hen the consul had finishcd, Catilina humbly enti-eated the. Senate
