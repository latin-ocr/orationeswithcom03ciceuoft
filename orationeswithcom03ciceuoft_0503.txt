CA P. 9, 10.

structio nec diuturna est, neque obducta ita ut curiosis oculis

perspici non possit.

X. Videbamus genus vitae, desidiam, inertiam, inclusas ejus
libidines, qui paullo propius accesserant, intuebantur: denique
etiam sermonis ansas dabat, quibus reconditos ejus sensus tenere

possemus.

Laudabat homo doctus philosophos nescio quos, neque

eorum tamen nomina poterat dicere: sed tamen eos laudabat
maxime, qui dicuntur praeter ceteros esse auctores et laudatores
voluptatis: cujus et quo tempore et quo modo non quaerebat;
verbum ipsum omnibus animi et corporis partibus devorabam
eosdemque praeclare dicere aiebat, sapientes omnia sua caussa

10. sermonis ansas] “ He gave handles
by his talk, so that we could lay hold of his
inmost thoughts.'’ Many of the critics
think that the expression is faulty, and they
have proposed various alterations.

philosophos nescio quos,] The Epicu-
reans. See De Amicit. c. 13.-ί cujus ι’ he
did not inquire what ⁴ pleasm·e,' but he
merely laid hold of the word, without know-
ing or caring what pleasnre Epicurus meant.
The pleasure of Epicurus was freedom from
all painful sensations.

partibus] The word ‘partibus' is not
in the MSS. It was added by Orelli.
Some word has been lost after ‘corporis'
Klotz tells us to compare De Harusp. c. 27 ε
“ quis minus umquam pepercit . . . omnibus
corporis sui partibus ;'' to which Halm adds
the passage in the Quum Senatui, c. 6:
“ eos qui disputent . . . in omni parte corpo-
ris,” διο.

omnia sua caussa] Manutius cites
Cicero, Ad Fam. vii. 12: “ Indicavit mihi
Pansa meus Epicureum te esse factum—
Sed quonam modo jus civile defendes, quum
omnia tua caussa facias, non civium ?’' So
we still teach and practise. When a man
does any thing, his motive, that which moves
him, is in himself, though his motive may
require an external thing to rouse it to
activity ; and the act which may and often
must have for its object things external to
the doer, has its full effect and completion
only in the doer’s consciousness of the thing
when it is done. Thus every act is reflected
on the agent in some degree, both bad and
good acts. A man does those acts which
are called bad generally in the view of a
direct profit resulting to himself, or that
which he considers t0 be a profit. He does
those which we call good not in the view
of direct profit to himself ; and herein con-
sists the difference between pure selfishness
and benevolence, for benevolence is often

apparently a simple movement to do good
to others 3 but though it seems to be simple,
and is so in immediate act, we are so con-
stituted that we feel pleasure from the bene-
volent act, and we may repeat it because it
is pleasant. In a sense then both the wise
and the foolish, the good and the bad, do
every thing with a view to themselves ; but
the wise and good are not consciously at
least moved solely by self-regard. Even
the highest object proposed for the practice
of Virtue in this life is reward, repaymeut
for what has been well done and well laid
out.

“A wise man should not meddle with
public affairs:” a doctrine which all fools
and knaves will certainly assent to, for they
will then have it their own way. A man
may keep clear of public affairs, because he
sets a high value on his tranquillity and on
preserving his integrity; but he keeps his
tranquillity and integrity by neglecting to do
his duty as a citizen. If a man knows that
he has neither ability to do good, nor honesty
enough to resist temptation, heis wise for
not trying to do what he cannot, and for
not putting himself in the way of temptation
which will overpower him. But few men
keep aloof from public matters for these
reasons; and in a country where a political
career is open, most men rush eagerly into
it with no direct motive, except the view of
their own advantage. The few who honestly
labour for the common good suffer for it
in the end, as Socrates (Apologia, c. 19)
thought, and perhaps he knew : “ There is
no man who will ever escape, if he honestly
opposes either you οι· any other popular
body, and if he tries to prevent many unjust
things and things contrary to law from being
done in the state ; but it is absolutely neces-
sary for him whose purpose is to fight truly
in defence of the right, if he would save
himself even for a time, to keep in a private
