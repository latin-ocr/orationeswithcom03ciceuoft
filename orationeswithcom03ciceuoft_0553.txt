probarent, optimates habebantur. Quis ergo iste optimus quisque?
Numero si quaeris, innumerabiles z—neque enim aliter stare pos-
semus z—sunt principes consilii publici, sunt qui eorum sectam
sequuntur, sunt maximorum ordinum homines, quibus patet curia,
sunt municipales rusticique Romani, sunt negotii gerentes, sunt
etiam libertini optimates. Numerus, ut dixi, hujus generis late et
varie diffusus est; sed genus universum, ut tollatur error, brevi
circumscribi et definiri potest. Omnes optimates sunt, qui neque
nocentes sunt nec natura improbi nec furiosi nec malis domesticis
impediti. Est igitur, ut ii sint quam tu nationem appellasti, qui
integri sunt et sani et bene de rebus domesticis constituti. Horum
qui voluntati, commodis, opinioni in gubernanda re publica serviunt,
defensores optimatium ipsique optimates gravissimi et clarissimi
cives numerantur et principes civitatis. Quid est igitur propo-
situm his rei publicae gubernatoribus, quod intueri et quo cursum
suum dirigere debeant? Id quod est praestantissimum maximeque
optabile omnibus sanis et bonis et beatis, cum dignitate otium. Hoc
qui volunt omnes optimates; qui efficiunt, summi viri et conser-
vatores civitatis putantur. Neque enim rerum gerendarum dig-

principes consilii publici] The prin· 45, 46) is an ‘egregius locus,⁷ and it has

cipal senators, and those who attach them-
selves to them (qui eorum sectam sequun-
tur). Abrami thought that ‘maximo-
rum.. . curia' meant thos se who had not
yet been invited by the censors to take
their seat in the Senate, but who having
had the ‘honores ' came into the Senate
‘ et sententiae jus habebant.' But Ferratius
remarks that Cicero is speaking of noble
youths and Equites who might arrive at the
Senate by the ‘honores,’ and had not yet
attained them.

neyotz‘i qerentes‚] ‘negotia' G. Halm
refers to Pro Quintio, c. 19: “ eques Ro-
manus locuples sui negotii bene gerens ;''
see the note (Vol. ΙΙ.).

Omnes optimates] ‘ Furiosi' is mad·
men, but here he means bad men, whose
passions are violent, I suppose. The men
‘domesticis malis impediti' arc men in
debt, or at least poor, though there is a
differ-enee. Manutius takes it to mean poor
men, and he acutely remarks that poverty
easily drives to crime. But Cicero cannot
mean simply poor, for a man may be poor
and content, and honest. He means men
who wanted money and had other wants
too, which money alone could satisfy3 and
such men may do any thing (c. 46). Cicero’s
definition of Optimates was enough to make
his hearers laugh. Halm says all this (cc,

been put by three German critics in their
books for the edification of German youth.

Est iyitur, ut] ‘ esto igitur ’ G. Mad-
vig conjectures ‘ sequitur ut 3' Bake ‘ effici-
tur ut 3¹ and Ieep ‘en igitur.y The mean-
ing is, if the text is right: “ The fact then
is that the honest and sound, and those
who are well settled in their domestic
affairs, are the men whom you have called a
‘ natio! '' Halm remarks that the subject
is ‘ qui integri sunt‚’ and ⁴ ii quam tu na-
tionem appellasti ' is the predicate3 which
is a true remark.

defensores optimatium] Halm says that
Orelli and Klotz placed a comma after
‘optimates,' which might have done no
harm in itself, but they misunderstood the
passage completely, for they thought that
the ‘ defensores optimatium ’ were different
from the ‘ipsi optimates) Cicero says:
“ Those who serve the wishes, the interests,
and the opinions of these men in the ad-
ministration of the state are the defenders
of the ‘optimates‚’ and themselves are rec-
koned the most solid of the ‘optimates,’
the most illustrious citizens and the chiefs of
the state ;'' as Halm has correctly explained
it.
