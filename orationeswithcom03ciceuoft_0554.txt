540 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

nitate homines efferri ita convenit ut otio non prospiciant, neque
ullum amplexari otium quod abhorreat a dignitate.

XLVI. Hujus autem otiosae dignitatis haec fundamenta sunt,
haec membra, quae tuenda principibus et vel capitis periculo defen-
denda sunt: religiones, auspicia, potestates magistratuum, senatus
auctoritas, leges, mos majorum, judicia, juris dictio, fides, pro-
vinciae, socii, imperii laus, res militaris, aerarium. Harum rerum
tot atque tantarum esse defensorem et patronum magni animi est,
magni ingenii magnaeque constantiae. Etenim in tanto civium
numero magna multitudo est eorum, qui aut propter metum poenae
peccatorum suorum conscii novos motus conversionesque rei pub-
licae quaerant, aut qui propter insitum quendam animi furorem
discordiis civium ac seditione pascantur, aut qui propter implica-
tionem rei familiaris communi incendio malint quam suo deflagrare.
Qui quum tutores sunt et duces suorum studiorum vitiorumque
nacti, in re publica fluctus excitantur, ut vigilandum sit iis qui sibi
gubernacula patriae depoposcerunt, enitendumque omni scientia ac
diligentia, ut conservatis iis quae ego paullo ante fundamenta ac
membra esse dixi tenere cursum possint et capere otii illum portum

of ‘rerum gerendarum 3' and the exception
is just. There is no great difficulty in the
meaning, nor more in the translation than
in many other passages: “For it is neither
right for men to be so far exaltet] by the
honour of public employment as to have
no concern for their tranquillity, nor to cling
to a tranquillity which is inconsistent with
honour.”

46. aerarium] Orelli tells us to observe
that the ¹ aerarium,' the treaffliry, the money
bagS‚ which in our times is the first ‘ mem-
brum ' of states, is here placed the last3 for
it is a climax from the greater to the less,
as the rank of a consular required. He adds,
and it is worth noting, that the Declamator,
Quum Senatui, c. 7, puts ⁶ aerarium ’
first. So he does, and properly enough
there.

qui aut propter metum poenae] Halm
refers to Tacitus (Anu. iii. 40), where he
is speaking of the insurrection of Florus
and Sacrovir, whose associates were either
impoverished men or nien who were guilty
of crimes and feared punishment. Cicero
enumerates three kinds of men who are
revolutionists3 men guilty of great crimes,
men of furious passions who get their
profit out of civil commotion, and men who
are embarrassed in their circumstances. He
does not, 1 suppose, by ‘discordiis . . .

pascantur ' mean any thing different from
what Ι have said. The elements of revolu-
tion always exist in all states, but there
are now other kinds of revolutionists and
other motives, besides these three base
motives; though these have had their effect
in modern times, and one of the French
revolutions is a revolution of insolvents.
But there is a modern revolutionist whom
neither Cicero nor the men of his time had
seen and could not conceive; a man who
honestly wishes to make men happier and
better by breaking their bonds and setting
them free, and with as little sels-regard in
pursuing his object as the weakness of our
common nature will allow. In other words
Cicero knew no revolutionist who was
not a bad man. Modern times have re-
volutionists of both kinds, bad and good3
some whose purpose is good3 others whose
purpose is bad. I speak not of the badness
or goo(lneSS‚ of the wisdom or the folly of
the means employed by the honest revolu-
tionist. I only speak with a view to Cicero‘s
text, the motives to revolution. In modern
times the motive to revolution is often per-
fectly pure ς a virtue of which antiquity, so
far as I knOW, has very few exampleS. But
perhaps there are some.

tutores] P. G. The common reading is
‘auctores'
