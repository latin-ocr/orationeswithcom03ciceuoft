240 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO, FLACCO

suspiciosissimo negotio maledictum omne, non modo crimen effugit?
Praetereo illa quae praetereunda non sunt: nullum hujus in privatis
rebus factum avarum, nullam in re pecuniaria contentionem, nullam
in re familiari sordem posse proferri. Quibus igitur testibus ego
hosce possum refutare nisi vobis? Tmolites ille vicanus, homo non
modo nobis, sed ne inter suos quidem notus, vos docebit qualis sit
L. Flaccus? quem vos modestissimum adolescentem, provinciae
maximae sanctissimum virum, nostri exercitus fortissimum militem,
diligentissimum ducem, temperatissimum legatum quaestoremque
cognoverunt3 quem vos praesentes constantissimum senatorem,
Justissimum praetorem, [atque] amantissimum rei publicae civem
judicavistis. IV. De quibus vos aliis testes esse debetis, de iis ipsi
alios testes audietis? At quos testes l primum dicam, id quod est
commune, Graecos—non quo nationi huic ego unus maxime fidem
derogem3 nam si quis umquam de nostris hominibus a genere isto
studio ac voluntate non abhorrens fuit, me et esse arbitror et magis
etiam tum quum plus erat otii fuisse: sed sunt in illo numero multi
boni, docti, pudentes, qui ad 1100 judicium deducti non sunt3 multi
impudentes, illiterati, leves, quos variis de caussis video concitatos
—verumtamen hoc dico de toto genere Graecorum : tribuo illis

vicanus] Some unknown fellow from
the ‘ vicus ' of Tmolus, or some small place
011 01 about the Tmolus3 a witness who
had said something against Flaccus. Cicero
begins by speaking contemptuously of the
witness. The inhabitants of some small
places are often named ⁴ vicani' in inscrip-
tions. The form of ¹ vicanus ’ may be com-
pared with ‘paganus'

4. primum (licam, . . . Graecos . . . ve-
rumtamen] The construction is irregular.
He begins ‘primum dicam . . . Graecos,'
which he iuterrupts by a long remark about
them; and hc resumes the matter with the
words ‘ verumtamen hoc dico.y Cicero will
allow the Greeks many great qualities3 but
they are liars3 they know not what au oath
is or good faith. Polybius, a Greek, had the
same opinion of his countrymen ς 31111 what
we know of their history confirms what he
says. The exceptions were few. Quin-
tilian (xi. 1, 89) 1135 3 remark on this pas-
sage of Cicero : “ Quod ad nationes exteras
pertinet, Cicero varie detracturus Graecis
testibus fidem, doctrinam iis concedit 30
litteras, seque ejus gentis amatorem esse
protitetur.” The testimony of the. Greek
against the Greeks is strougvr than Cicero’s.
Polybius attributes their want of saith to
their want of religion : ‘⁶ The Roman polity

seems to me to show the greatest diversity
from other systems, and to the advantage
of the Romans, in the notions about the
gods; and I am of opinion that what is
made a matter of reproach among the rest
of mankind is the very thing which keeps
together the Roman state3 and I mean re-
ligion (or superstition). For among the
Romans this part of polity has been in-
vested with such tragic solemnity, and has
been carried among them both into private
life and public affairs to such a degree as to
leave nothing undone. Now this to most
people might seem strange; but Ι think
that they 'have done this for the sake of the .'
people. For if it were possible to form a
polity of wise men, perhaps such a fashion
as this would not be necessary. But since
every multitude 15 fickle and full of unlaw-
sul desires, unreasoning impulse, violent
passion, it remains to hold multitudes to-
gether by the sear of things unseen and by
such tragieal solemnity. Accordingly the
rnen of old times seem to me to have intro-
duced among the multitude, not inconsi-
‹lerately and without a purpose, the opinions
about the gods, and the notions about the
things in llades; but much rather do the
111011 of the present time seem to drive out
these opinions and notions inconsideratcly
