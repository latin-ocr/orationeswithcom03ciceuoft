Caii aut Appii Claudiorum? Illi quum ludos facerent, servos de
cavea exire jubebant; tu in alteram servos immisisti, ex altera
liberos ejecisti. Itaque qui antea voce praeconis a liberis semove-
bantur, tuis ludis non voce sed manu liberos a se segregabant.
XIII. Ne hoc quidem tibi in mentem veniebat, Sibyllino sacerdoti,
haec sacra majores nostros ex vestris libris expetisse? si illi sunt
vestri, quos tu impia mente conquiris, violatis oculis legis, con-
taminatis manibus attrectas. Hac igitur vate suadente qnondam,
defessa Italia Punico bello atque ab Hannibale vexata, sacra ista

femina autem, quae matronarum castissima putabatur, Q. Claudia:
cujus priscam illam severitatem sacrificii mirifice tua soror existi-

his religionibus, neque sacerdotium ipsum, quo est haec tota religio
constituta, neque curulis aedilitas, quae maxime hanc tueri reli-
gionem solet, permovit quo minus castissimos ludos omni flagitio
pollueres, dedecore maculares, scelere obligaresZ Sed quid ego

the Italian Servile war.

There is more of the antithesis to wind
up the chapter, ‘exire jubebant’ and ‘ im-
misisti,’ * non voce sed manu!

13. si illi sunt vestri . . . attrecta-sn]
Clodius, we must assume, was a decemvir.
Gellius (i. 19) has the story of the Sibyl
and her books: ‘⁶ Libri tres in sacrarium
conditi Sibyllini appellati. Ad eos quasi
ad oraculum Quindecemviri adeunt, quum
dii immortales consulendi sunt.'’

Markland found fault with the words
‘si illi sunt‚' διο. Gesner defends it all at
great length, and even ‘violatis oculis' by
giving to ‘ violatis' an active sense. Klotz
remarks that the words ‘ si illi sunt vestri ’
merely refer to ‘ex vestris libris‚' and the
meaning is this, “if ‘your books' is the
right expression for those which thou with
impious mind consultcst ;” and ‘⁸ with this,'’
118 adds, “ Markland’s and Wolf’s censure
would be excluded.⁷' It is too tedious to
state all that the critics have said here. I
see no objection to Klotz's explanation.
But what then? It is still what it was;
very silly.

Claudia :] She is mentioned by Livy
(29. c. 14). WVhen Scipio received the
goddess from her priests at the mouth of
the Tiber, he handed her over to the wo-
men: “Matronae primores civitatis, inter

Pessinuntem] Pessinus in Phrygia, as it
is here called (c. 13), but it was in Galatia
near the Sangarius, and the place where the
stone was brought from. Clodius is charged
with selling to Brogitarus the temple and
its lands at Pessinus3 but he wasted it
first (vastaris); which is not wise to do
when a man intends to sell a thing. In the
oration Pro Sestio, c. 211¹, it is said that the
‘fanum’ was sold to Brogitar for a large
sum of money, but nothing is said of its
being wasted3 nor yet in Strabo (p. 567),
We know our writer well. He lays hold of
facts and spoils them by something of his
own. lf Clodius sold and the Gallo-Greek
bought, we may be sure that there was
something worth the money. It appears
from the latter part of the chapter that
Brog-itar was son-in-law of Deio-tar. Both
of these are genuine Gallie names. The
Gallie chiefs of Galatia interinarried with
the Greeks, but they kept their names, and
the common sort kept their language t00.
This Brogitar is mentioned in the oration
Pro Sestio, c. 26, and in the letters to
Quintus, ii. 9. The author speaks ofthe great
antiquity of this stone-worship at Pessinus,
and of its having been respected by the
