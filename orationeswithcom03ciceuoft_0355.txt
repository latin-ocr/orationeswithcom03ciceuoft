Romanum semper fore numenque vestrum aeque mihi grave et
sanctum ac deorum immortalium in omni vita futurum: deinde,
quoniam me in civitatem res publica ipsa reduxit, nullo me loco
rei publicae defuturum. Quod siquis existimat me aut voluntate
esse mutata aut debilitata virtute aut animo fracto, vehementer

errat.

Mihi, quod potuit vis et injuria et sceleratorum hominum

furor detrahere, eripuit, abstulit, dissipavit: quod viro forti adimi

non potest, id manet et permanebit.

Vidi ego fortissimum virum,

municipem meum, C. Marium,—quoniam nobis, quasi aliqua fatali

numenque vestrum] This startles a reader:
“and your divinity shall be as solemn in
my judgment and as holy as the divinity of
the immortal gods.'’ Just as in the De
Domo (c. 39) he says “ O dii immortales . . .
vestrum numen horret?'' Markland ob-
serves that Cicero, Pro C. Rabirio, c. 2,
says of the Quirites, “quorum potestas
proxime ad deorum immortalium numen
accedit ;’' and there is a passage in the Pro
Murena, c. l, which goes a little further:
“Omnis deorum potestas aut translata est
ad vos aut certe communicata vobi—cum ;'’
and again in the Pro Cluentio, c. 69, there
is something to the like effect addressed to
the judices. But ‘your divinity' is more
than this. Gesner asks in reply to these
objections, what shall we say of the passage
in the De Lege Agraria, ii. 35, “ Haec qui
prospexerunt, majores nostros dico, non eos
in deorum immortalium numero venerandos
a nobis et colendos putatis ?'' We shall
say that there is a very great difference be-
tween speaking of the ‘majores’ as raised
to the company of the deities for their great
deeds, and addressing the rout of Rome by
the title of ‘ your divinityship.'

O. Marium . . . tum se . . . miserum,]
Markland thought that it should be ‘non
fuisse miserum,’ as Hotmann also had
thought, in order that the whole sentence
may be consistent. Hotmann supposed it
to be inconsistent to say that Marius was a
courageous and firm man, that he never
lost his manly spirit (virtutem animi), and
to say at the same time that he was ι1111561·,’
unhappy‚ wretched. However we cannot
alter an author simply to mend him: and
it is plain that this alteration would not
improve the original. The whole passage
is one of the most absurd. The ραι-60111611»
cal clause ⁴ quoniam . . . belligerandum fuit'
contains, I suppose, the author’s reason for
mentioning Marius. He compares Marius
and himself, both of whom had fought
‘ cum his qui haec delere voluissent.' He
of course alludes to Cicero’s consulship, but
it is not certain to what part of Marius’

life he alludes. In order that it may be
possible to establish a comparison, he ought
to mean Marius’ enemies, who drove him
from Rome ; but this would be a very strange
kind of comparison, for Marius was driven out
by the faction of Sulla. He resumes—‘eum
tamen vidi) If any body will explain what
‘ tamen ' means here, he will deserve thanks.
The word ‘ belligerando ’ or ¹ belligerendo'
occurs in the speech Pro Fonteio, c. 16.

He saw Marius and he heard him say
what he says that he did say. This seems
to show a certain familiarity with the old
soldier after he had returned from Africa
and filled Rome with carnage. Marius was
driven out of Rome B.c. 88. His escape
and adventures are told by Appian (B. C. i.
55—(52) and by Plutarch (Sulla and Ma-
rius). The marshes of Minturnae, the mud
and the prison, the begging in Africa, where
the magniloquent writer falsely says that he
‘had given kingdomS‚’ formed a rhetorical
common-place.

“Exsilium et carcer Minturnarumque

Et ffihliiffl‘icszatus victa Carthagine panis.’'
(Juv. Χ. 276.)

The Declamator has forgotten the prison
of Minturnae and the tragic scene with the
barbarian who was sent in to kill Marius.
But he has told us that C. Marius being
plunged in the mud saved his ‘eorpus ac
vitam’ by the Minturnenses flocking to
help him, and pitying his misfortunes. He
means of course that they helped him out
of the mud, for he saved his ‘ corpus ’ that
way, which was heavy and unwieldy3 and
he saved not only his ‘corpus' but his
‘vita;' which we might perhaps have in-
ferred without being told. We have the
story in the genuine Cicero (Pro Sestio, e.
22: ‘¹ Memineram, judices, divinum illum
virum . . . C. Marium,'’ &c.)‚ where it is
told in a different way3 and though the
prison is omitted there also, the brief nar-
rative is in Cicero's best style.

Marius entered Rome again in B.c. 87,
