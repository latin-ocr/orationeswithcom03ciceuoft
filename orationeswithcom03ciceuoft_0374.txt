360 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA
sui faces inflammaret: negat oportuisse quidquam uni extra
ordinem decerni. Non jam tibi sic respondebo ut ceteris: Cn.
Pompeio plurima, periculosissima, maxima mari terraque bella
extra ordinem esse commissa, quarum rerum si quem poeniteat,
eum victoriae populi Romani [neeesse est] poenitere. Non ita
Cum his haec a me haberi oratio potest, qui ita dis-
putant, se, si qua res ad unum deferenda sit, ad Cn. Pompeium
delaturos potissimum, sed se extra ordinem nihil cuiquam dare3
quum Pompeio datum sit, id se pro dignitate hominis ornare ac
tueri solere. Horum ego sententiam ne laudem impedior Cn.
Pompeii triumphis, quibus ille, quum esset extra ordinem ad patriam
defendendam vocatus, auxit nomen populi Romani imperiumque
honestavit: constantiam probo, qua mihi quoque utendum fuit,
quo ille auctore extra ordinem bellum cum Mithridate Tigraneque
gessit. Sed cum illis possum tamen aliquid disputare: tua vero
quae tanta impudentia est ut audeas dicere, extra ordinem dari
nihil cuiquam oportere? qui, quum lege nefaria Ptolemaeum, regem
Cypri, fratrem regis Alexandrini, eodem jure regnantem, caussa
incognita public-asses populumque Romanum scelere obligasses3
quum in ejus regnum, bona, fortunas patrocinium hujus imperii

[necesse est]poe71itere.] Some MSS. have
‘necesse est.' If we can get rid of it, as
Baiter does, so much the better. It is said
that it is omitted in some MSS.

Cum his haec . . . Sed cum illis] Manu-
tius has given an explanation of all this. It
may be left to any reader who can use his
judgment, to see what there is in it. Cicero
had recommended the conferring of an ex-
traordinary authority on Pompeius for pro-
secuting the war against Mithridates (De
Imp. Cn. Pompeii, Vol. ΙΙ.).

Ptolemaeum,] The story of this king of
Cyprus is told in the oration Pro Sestio, c.
26, where there is also the expression “ rex
. . . cum bonis omnibus publicaretur.'' This
Ptolemaeus who was in possession of Cyprus,
was a brother of Ptolemaeus Auletes. Clo-
dius had been made prisoner by the pirates
about nine years before, and Ptolemaeus
being asked to contribute towards his ran-
som, sent two talents, which Clodius was
not pleased with, and he took the opportu-
nity of getting Cato sent to Cyprus to seize
the island in the name of the Roman peo-
ple. Cato did not like the mission, but he
went. The unfortunate king of Cyprus
poisoned himself, and Cato sold his move-
ables for the best price that he could get
(Plutarch, Cato, c. 36). The seizure of

Cyprus was one of the most dishonest acts
that the Roman state ever committed3 and the
number of their dishonest acts was not small
(Velleius, ii. 45; Dion Cassius, 38. c. 30).
patrocinium] The MSS. reading is ‘ pa-
trocinium,’ the reading of all the MSS. I
suppose. ‘ Latrocininm, Naugerius,’ Bai-
ter, and others. Niigelsbach, quoted by
Baiter, proposes ‘fortunas, patrimonium,
vim hujus imperii,’ which is no doubt very
good; but that is no reason for accepting
the alteration. It has been asked what
‘patrocinium hujus imperii ' means? It
means the ‘ patronage,’ in the Roman sense,
of the Roman state3 but I do not affirm
that there is any sense in it. The ‘ latro-
cinium’ offends some editors, for it is strange
that Cicero should speak thus of Rome,
and of Cato her agent. Gruter thought‘
the expression was too hard to be applied
to the Senators of Rome, but Wolf removes
this difficulty: ⁴⁴ Sed parum ille novit hunc
Scriptorem, qui dum Clodium insectetur,
ne Senatui quidem parcit, nec populo Clo-
dianum scelus probanti, nec Catoni, viro
sanctissimo, neque bono usui sermonis.''
He adds, who ever before said ‘ homines
publicare ?’ No one, I believe. The expres-
sion in the oration Pro Sestio, c. ‘26 (pre-
ceding note), is strange enough, but it may
