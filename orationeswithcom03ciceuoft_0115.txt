OAP. 4—6. 101

patre suo imperatore non meruisset, aut hostem aut patris imperium
timuisse aut a parente repudiatus videretur. An quum sedere in
equis triumphantium praetextati potissimum filii soleant, huic donis
militaribus patris triumphum decorare fugiendum fuit, ne rebus
communiter gestis paene simul cum patre triumpharet? Hic vero,
judices, et fuit in Asia, etviro fortissimo, parenti suo, magno
adjumento in periculis, solatio in laboribus, gratulationi in victoria
fuit. Et si habet Asia suspicionem luxuriae quandam, non Asiam
numquam vidisse, sed in Asia continenter vixisse laudandum est.
Quamobrem non Asiae nomen objiciendum Murenae fuit, ex qua
laus familiae, memoria generi, honos et gloria nomini constituta est3
sed aliquod aut in Asia susceptum aut ex Asia deportatum flagi-
tium ac dedecus. Meruisse vero stipendia in eo bello, quod tum
populus Romanus non modo maximum sed [etiam] solum gerebat,
virtutis, patre imperatore libentissime meruisse, pietatis3 finem
stipendiorum patris victoriam ac triumphum fuisse, felicitatis fuit.
Maledieto quidem idcirco nihil in hisce rebus loci est, quod onmia
13115 occupavit.

VI. Saltatorem appellat L. Murenam Cato. Maledictum est, si

sedere in equis] The man who triumphed
took¹his little children and kinsfolk of both
sexes into his triumphal chariot, which must
have been rather large if it contained such a
party. Those who were grown up rode 011
1101505, which were either attached to the
chal-iot, or, if there were too many of them,

παρῄοροι, 1110 1101505 placed one on each side
of the ‘jugales ;’ and it seems the better con-
clusion that nobody rode on the ⁶ equi
jugales.’ Domitian rode on a white horse
in the triumph of his father Vespasian and
his brother Titus (Sue-ton. Dom. c. 2). See
also Tacit. Anu. ii. 41. The unworthy

 

they rode on horses behind (Graevius).
Appian (Punica, 0. 66, and the note ot* Tol-
lius), who describes a Roman triumph, says:
Ἰἳπιβιιὶικουσι δ’ αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τό ἅρμα παῖδὲς
τε καὶ παρθένοι, καῖ ἐπὶ τῶν παρῃόρων
ἑκατέρωθεν ἠΐθεοι, συγγενεῖς. Tiberius
rode in the triumph of Octavianus: ‘⁶ De-
hinc pubescens Actiaco triumpho currum
Augusti comitatus est, sinisteriore funali
equo, quum Marcellus Octaviae filius dexte-
riore veheretur'’ (Sueton. Tiber. c. 6; and
the note of Torrentius). There are gold
medals of Augustus extant, in which he
appears in a ehariot drawn by four elephants,
with a man mounted on each. Torrentius
supposed that these were young Romans,
but they were Indians who managed the
elephants, as Cuper. de Eleph. Exere. ll.
c. 10. p. 229, shows (Burmann). Graevius
in his note on Florus (iv. 2) has also pro-
duced a coin of a triumphal procession.
The authority for persons being mounted
on the ⁴ equi jugales,' on the two horses on
each side of the pole, is Zonaras. But Ap-
pian only mentions the ‘equi funales,’ or

triumph of Murena’s father was for his vic-
tories, such as they were, over Mithridates.
(Vol. II. Introduction to the oration De
Imp. Cn. Pompeii)

ne rebus] M. and Halm. G. has ‘ut
rebus‚' and Ε. 1135 ‘ne ut rebus.² I do
not understand ‘ut.' ⁴ Ne ' is intelligible:
“ Should Murena, who had gained military
honours (dona militaria) have refused to
adorn his father’s triumph, and when he
had assisted his father in his wars, should
he not have made himself almost a partner
in his triumph ? ’³ See De Imp. Cn. Pom—
peii, 0. 3, note (Vol. IL).

susceplzcm—flayitium] See De Imp. Cn.
Pompeii, 0. 3, note on ⁴ macula—concepta.’

etiam solum] G. omits ‘etiaim' and it is
better omitted.

6. Saltatorem] He was reproached with
having danced, not as a man might dance
now, Ι suppose, in society, but at such
revels as Cicero describes. Sempronia (In-
troduction to the orations against Catilina)
danced too well for an honest woman;
which means that her dancing was not.
