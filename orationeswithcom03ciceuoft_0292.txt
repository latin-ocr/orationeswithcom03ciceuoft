ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

XXXIV. At enim Androni Sextilio gravis injuria facta est et
non ferenda3 quod, quum esset ejus uxor Valeria intestato mortua,

34. uxor Valeria] The name shows that
Valeria was of the same gens as L. Valerius
Flaccus. She died intestam, and the gover-
nor claimed the ‘hereditas,’ or a portion of
it as one of her next of kin, according to
the Law of the Twelve Tables (Ulpian‚
Frag. xxvi. l): “ Si intestato moritur cui
suus heres nec escit, agnatus proxumus
familiam habeto.” The word ‘intenderit‘
is a technical word: the ‘intentio ¹ in a for-
mula of action ‘⁴ est ea pars formulae, qua
actor desiderium suum concludit” (Gaius,
iv. 41 .

Thgre was nothing to say against this
claim of Flaccus, if he was one of the next
of kim—But, says the other side, she was
‘ingenua,’ a free-born woman, which in-
volves a tacit assumption that Flaccus said
she was a freedwoman, and that he could
only claim the ‘ hereditas' by virtue of his
patronal rights, in the defect of ‘sui heredes)
The Scholiast tells us that Valeria was a
¹ liberta.' Cicero neither says that she was
or was not. If she was a ‘liberta' the
claim of the patroni was legal. The remark
of the Scholiast with this exception is good:
“Hoc autem juris observabatur, ut loco
filiarum haberentur quae in manum viris
convenissent. Verum haec fuit Valeria de
libertis Flacci3 ac propterea in legitima
tutela quasi apud patronum habebatur3 nec
videri poterat jure in manum convenisse,
quum hic ei tutor legitimus auctor non fue-
rit, et ideo hereditas ad hunc Flaccum legi-
timo jure pervenerit'' (p. 244, ed. Orelli).

When the opposite side says, “she was
‘ ingenua,’ a free-born woman,'’ they give
up the other defence3 for they knew that if
she was a ‘ freed woman,’ the husband could
have no claim. Cicero admits that the
woman was ‘ingenua;' and then he asks,
“What, does not the property of ‘inge-
nuae ⁷ pass by rule of law (lege) in case of
their dying intestate ?” The other side now
take a new line of defence. They would
exclude Flaccus’ claim by setting up the
husband’s right by the marriage. “She
was his wife,'’ they say, “after the strict
form '’ (in manu). There were three modes
by which the strict Roman marriage was
effected, Usu, Farreo‚ Coemptione (Gaius,
i. 110). The ‘ confarreatio ' was a religious
ceremony, which could not apply to this
case, and so Cicero says nothing about it.
The ‘coemptio’ was in the form of a sale
(Gaius, i. 113), and it is a just conclusion
that the old Roman marriage was a sale.
The English law in some respects vicws it

as such, a sale by the woman of herself for
money or money’s worth settled on her: a
valuable consideration is marriage, as the
lawyers call it. The marriage by ‘ usus ’
was simply cohabitation with the intention
of living together always; but by a year’s
use the man obtained the legal possession
of the woman, who became in all legal re-
spects the same as his daughter (Gaius, i.
]11). This effect of the ‘usus’ was the
‘ in manum conventio,' which could be pre-
vented by the woman staying away from
her husband’s house for three continuous
nights in each year. The consequence of
the ‘conventio in manum’ was that the
woman was released from the ‘potestas ' of
her father, if she had a father, or from the
‘ tutela' of her Tutores, if she had Tutores.
All that she acquired belonged to her hus-
band, and she ceased to have any property
of her own (Gaius, ii. 86. 90. 98; and Top.
c. 4: “ Quum mulier viro in manum con-
venit, omnia quae mulieris fuerunt viri
fiunt nomine dotis'’).

Cicero tells us that Valeria was in ‘tutela
legitima‚' that is, her property was under
the care of ‘tutores.’ None had been ap-
pointed by testament, and the Lex accord-
ingly determined who they should be. In
order that the ‘ usus’ might have the effect
of the ‘conventio in manum,⁷ we are told
that the Tutores must have given their
‘auctoritas’ or legal assent 3 for the ‘ag-
nati' were the persons entitled to the
woman’s succession, if she did not come ‘in
manum viri.y “Quibus testamento qui-
dem tutor datus non sit, iis ex lege ΧΠ
agnati sunt tutores, qui vocantur legitimi⁷'
(Gaius, i. 155). A person who was under
the care of such Tutores was said to be in
‘tutela legitima? Again‚ the ‘agnati' are
thus defined: ‘⁴ Sunt autem agnati per viri-
lis sexus personas cognatione juncti, quasi
a patre cognati: veluti frater eodem patre
natus, fratris filius, neposve ex eo, item
patronus et patroni filius et nepos ex eo ''
(Gaius, i. 156). A woman had no ‘sui
heredes,' for ‘sui heredes’ are thus de-
fined: ⁴⁴ Sui heredes existimantur liberi qui
in potestate morientis fuerint, veluti filius
filiave, nepos neptisve ex filio, pronepos
proneptisve ex nepote tilio nato prognatus
prognatave.'' (Just. Inst. iii. l, 2.)

If then there were children, they could
not succeed to the mother as ⁶ sui heredes,’
because they were not in the ‘potestas' of
the mother. They could only succeed to
the mother as being her brothers and sis-
