ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

proposita amplissimae dignitatis, deinde L. Torquati, fortissimi
consulis, constantissimi senatoris, semper optimi civis, filius, inter-
dum efferatur immoderatione verborum? qui quum suppressa voce
de scelere P. Lentuli, de audacia conjuratorum omnium dixisset,
tantummodo ut vos qui ea probatis exaudire possetis, de supplicio,

de Lentulo, de carcere, magna et queribunda voce dicebat.

In

quo primum illud erat absurdum, quod, quum ea quae leviter dixerat
vobis probare volebat, eos autem qui circum judicium stabant audire

nations, where a part of the hearers appears
to be at a distance (c. 12), or the voice of
the speaker appears to be in a low tone, as
Cicero (Ad Att. iv. 8, (i) : ⁴ dic oro te
clarius3 vix enim mihi exaudisse videor;’
Curtius vii. 31, 20: ‘haec quassa adhuc
voce, vix proximis exaudientibus, dixerat.'
Accordingly the passage in Cat. iv. 7 is
easily understood.'' The passage is ‘⁴ Sed ea
quae exaudio dissimulare non possum.
Jaciuntur enim voces quae perveniunt ad
aures meas.'' And yet here he translates
‘exaudio' by ‘deutlich h'oreff Cicero did
hear: that is certain3 but it was not in-
tended that he should hear. In this oration
he says “maxima voce ut omnes exaudire
possint ;'' which to adopt Halm's expres-
sion ‘is easily understood‚’ but not if we
take ‘ exaudire ’ to mean by itself what he
says. Cicero adds ‘ omnes,’ ‘¹ ut omnes
exaudire possint :’' “with all the power of
my voice that it may reach all even those
furthest off, I say and 1 always shall say.'’
de supplic-io, (Ie Leucata] ‘de supplicio
[de Lentulo],’ Halm, after two of the best
MSS„ as he says, T. V. The reading of B.
is ‘ Lentuli,' and of the rest ‘ P. Lentuli.'
Halm says that the reading ‘ P. Lentuli ’ is
faulty for two reasons, first, because of the
repetition of the praenomen, the words ‘ de
scelere Ρ. Lentuli ’ having already occurred 3
second, because if any thing is added to
⁴ de supplici0,’ the rules of rhetoric require
some addition also to ‘de carcere.'——It is
the duty of a commentator to state the
opinions of other commentators in cases
where there may be a difference of opinion,
and readers may judge for themselves. It
is not always his duty to answer objections.
He may think that they are sometimes not
worth answering. I should prefer ⁴ de sup-
plicio P. Lentuli,’ if the best MSS. had it.
After the man had spoken ‘ suppressa voce
de scelere P. Lentuli, de andacia conjurato-
rum omnium,' and spoken so low that only
the judices could hear, who approved of the
conspirators’ punishment, he spoke ‘de
supplicio P. Lentuli,' or ‘ de supplicio, de

Lentulo‚' in a loud tone, so loud that every
body could hear. He spoke aloud, not of
the crime, which was great, but of the
punishment, which was severe, and with
the view of making Cicero unpopular. As
he mentioned crime and Lentulus, when he
was speaking only to be heard by the ju-
dices, he would say punishment and Len-
tulus when he wished all to hear him. And
why mention Lentulus before all others?
Because he was a praetor, and a man of
rank, who aspired to sovereignty in Rome
(In Cat. iii. 4); and this is the answer to
Garatoni’s feeble attempt to find a reason
for omitting ‘ P. Lentuli ' in the words ‘de
scelere P. Lentuli) Garatoni misunderstood
the passage altogether, while he was trying
to mend it. Among other things he asks,
“Quid enim scelus uni Lentulo, audacia
reliquis adsignetur? quaenam haec inaudita
partiti0?'' Halm correctly observes that
the words ‘ conjuratorum omnium’ show
that another name had been mentioned be-
fore. Cato, in his speech on the punish-
ment of the conspirators, mentions only
Lentulus by name: ⁴⁸ Quam quum de P.
Lentulo ceterisque statuetis '⁹ (Sallust, Cat.
c. 52). The reason is plain. Lentulus was
the greatest criminal they had caught.

vobis probare] ⁴ To make you believe‚’
‘to get your assent to what he said.’ In
‘ qui id non probabatis‚’ ‘ probare ' has the
other meaning ⁶ to appi-ove) Orelli says of
⁴ leviter :⁷ ‘leniter Cdd. pauci.' Sylvius
and Ursini would read ‘leniter.’ Gruter
objects to Lambinus foisting in ‘leniter,’
for Catullus (84), he says, teaches that we
may say both :

“ Audibant eadem haec leniter ac leviter.''

On this Graevius says that ⁶ leviter audire '
is well said, but ‘leviter dicere,' in the
sense of ‘ suppressa voce‚' cannot be ap-
proved. Halm explains ‘leviter’ to mean
‘slightly,' ⁶ by the way, without making the
words emphatic by the strength of the voice

or the weight of the expression! ‘ Leviter ’
is the reading of T. V. B. S.
