ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT.

reportarit, non committam, patres conscripti, ut, quum ea mihi sint
restituta, quae in potestate mea non fuerunt, ea non habeam, quae
ipse praestare possim, praesertim quum illa amissa recuperarim,
virtutem et fidem numquam amiserim.

bore him on her shoulders and carried him
into Rome.’' Klotz takes this as evidence
that Cicero publicly used this expression;
and says that it may also be considered as
an external evidence of its genuineness3 it
however occurs no where else in these
speeches, and we may assume that Cicero
purposely avoided using it afterwards.—But
why should he avoid using it afterwards?
because he was laughed at for it, I suppose.
If he wrote this speech and published it,
his enemies would have matter enough to

laugh at as long as he lived.

The Declamator however does not say
that all Italia brought him back on her
shoulders: it brought him back ‘paene
suis humeris! So Marius did not destroy
all the Senate, but ‘cunctum senatum paene
delevit ;' and the men were not called up
from Acheron (c. 10), but ‘ paene ex Ache-
ronte excitatos? and he goes on in the
same way all through these speeches (De
Domo, c. 51).
