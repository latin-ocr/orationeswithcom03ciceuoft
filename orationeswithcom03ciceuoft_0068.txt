54 ORAT. III. IN L. CATILINAM

oratio mea, rem ita comprehenderem, ut tum demum animis saluti
vestrae provideretis, quum oculis maleficium ipsum videretis. Ita-
que ut comperi legatos Allobrogum belli Transalpini et tumultus
Gallici excitandi caussa a P. Lentulo esse sollicitatos, eosque in Gal-
liam ad suos cives eodemque itinere cuin litteris mandatisque ad Ca-
tilinam esse missos, comitemque iis adjunctum esse T. Vulturcium,
atque huic esse ad Catilinam datas litteras, facultatem mihi obla-
tam putavi, ut, quod erat difficillimum, quodque ego semper optabam
ab dis immortalibus, tota res non solum a ine sed etiam a senatu et
a vobis manifesto deprehenderetur. Itaque hesterno die L. Flac-
cum et C. Pomptinum, praetores fortissimos atque amantissimos
rei publicae viros, ad me vocavi, rem [omnem] exposui, quid fieri
placeret ostendis.. Illi autem, qui onmia de re publica praeclara,
atque egregia sentirent, sine recusat-ione ac sine ulla mora nego-
tium susceperunt‚ et quum advesperasceret occulte ad pontem
Mulvium pervenerunt atque ibi in proximis villis ita bipartito
fuerunt ut Tiberis inter eos et pons interesset. Eodem autem et
ipsi sine cujusquam suspicione multos fortes viros eduxerunt, et ego
ex praefectura Reatina complures delectos adolescentes, quorum

Allobroyum] This story of the Allobroges
and of their betrayal of the conspirators is
in Sallust (Cat. c. 41). They gave the
information to their patronus Q. Fabius
Sanga, who carried it to Cicero. (Introduc-
tion.)—‘tumultus‘ is a sudden rising, a
term peculiarly applied by the Romans to
the sudden outbreaks in Gallia Cisalpina
before that country was subdued (Cic. Phil.
viii. c. l : ⁴⁶ itaque majores nostri tumultum
Gallicum, quod erat Italiae finitimus, prae-
terea nullum nominabant.'' Vol. I. Verr.
ii. 4. c. 23).

P. Lentulo] P. Cornelius Lentulus Sura
was praetor in this year, B.c. 63. He was
one of the ‘quaestores urbani’ in 13.c. 81
(Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 1. c. 14). In 13.c. 7l he
was consul. He had been ejected from the
Senate for his scandalous life, but he got
admission again into the body by being
elected praetor. (Introduction.)—T. Vul-
turcium: a native of Croton in Magna
Graecia (Sallust, (Jat. (⁵. 44)

L. Flaccum] lle was propraetor of the
province of Asia after liis praetorship. lle
was prosecuted irc. 59 for chctundac,
and defended by Cicero in an oration which
is extant. C. Pomptinus was propraetor
of Gallia Narbonensis in 1³.e.ss2. lle dc-
fcated the Allobroges at Solonium (Livy,
Epit. 103; Dion Cassius, 37. c. 47), and
had a triumph ac. 54. Ile was afterwards

(B. c. 51) a legatus of Cicero in Cilicia.

qui-sentirentfl “Being men who had
towards the state every noble and honour-
able feeling.” This use of ¹ qui ’ and a sub-
junctive is easily understood by a careful
reader of Cicero. It is one of his common
forms of expression.

pontem Mulvimn] This bridgc, now
Ponte Molle, was over the Tiber. lt is
two miles from the Porta Flaminia, now
Porta del Popolo. to the Ponte Molle. The
old bridge does not exist, and a modern
bridge stands in its place. (Westphal, Die
Romische Kainpagne‚ p. 133.) The Pons
Mulvius was built by the censor M. Aemil-
ius Scaurus, and it has been conjectured
that the name Pons Milvius or Mulvius is
a popular corruption of Pons Aemilius.

Reatina] Reate (Rieti) was a Sabine
town in the vallcy of the VelinuS. It be-
came a Praefectura in the third Samnite
war. Reate is mentioned among the Prae—
fecturae in thc passage of Festus (p. 233.
Nun). Since the enactnwnt of the Lex
,Iulia (11.0. 90) it had the Roman Civitas;
bnt it was still usual to spcak of towns as
l'racfecturae and Municipia after they had
got the ('ivitas. (l'raefecturaz see Vol. II.
Pro (J. Rabirio, c. 8.) llahn observes that
Cicero was a Patronus of the Reatini, and
could accordingly dcpcnd on them. He
says (Oratio Pro M. Aemilio Scauro, 5 27):
