mines hanc contentionem fuisse, ut alii dicerent animos hominum
sensusque morte restingui, alii autem tum maxime mentes sapien-
tium ac fortium virorum, quum e corpore excessissent, sentire ac
vigere? quorum alterum fugiendum non esse, carere sensu; alterum
etiam optandum, meliore esse sensu. Denique, quum omnia semper
ad dignitatem rettulissem nec sine ea quidquam expetendum esse
homini in vita putassem, mortem, quam etiam virgines Athenis,
regis, opinor, Erechthei filiae, pro patria contempsisse dicuntur,
ego vir consularis tantis rebus gestis timerem? praesertim quum
ejus essem civitatis, ex qua O. Mucius solus in castra Porsennae
venisset eumque interficere proposita sibi morte conatus esset: ex
qua P. Decius primum pater, post aliquot annos patria virtute
praeditus filius se ac vitam suam instructa acie pro salute populi
Romani victoriaque devovisset: ex qua innumerabiles alii partim
adipiscendae laudis, partim vitandae turpitudinis caussa mortem in
variis bellis aequissimis animis oppetissent: in qua civitate ipse
meminissem patrem hujus M. Crassi, fortissimum virum, ne videret

alii dicerent] The Epicurei, as Halm jam desperata hoc genere piaculi compara-

says; but others also, the Stoics for in· retur. Auctor est exempli Varro libro hu-

stance, were not agreed about a future ex-
istence. The Socratici believed in a future
existence3 or Socrates did, as we learn from
Plato's Apology and the Phaedon.

tum maaez'me mentes] In his Laelius (c. 4)
we have Cicero's apparent opinion when he
was older: ‘⁴ animos hominum esse divinos,
iisque quum e corpore excessissent reditum
in caelum patere optimoque et justissimo
cuique expeditissimum.'' Cicero says that
some thought one thing on the immortality
of the soul and some thought another 3 but
he does not declare his own opinion here.
He had however ridiculed the notions about
punishment after death as an old woman’s
story (Pro Cluentio, c. 61, Vol. IL). It
seems very doubtful if his own opinion of a
future life was settled. There is another
passage (De Sen. (¹. 23): “sed nescio quo-
modo animus erigens se ad posteritatem
ita semper prospiciebat quasi quum exces-
sisset e vita tum denique victurus esset.''

quinon] This is his way of referring to a
thing on which he does not dwell or does
not treat, as if it belonged to his purpose to
trouble himself about such things: ‘⁶ idem,
opinor, artifex ejusmodi Cupidinem fecit’'
(Verr. ii. 4. c. 2).

Erechthei filiae‚] “ Erechtheus—cujus
filiae virgines, quum gravi bello Athenienses
oppugnarentur nec ulla spes salutis osten-
deretur, sumptis infulis ad aram steterunt:
nam ita responsum erat, ut salus patriae

manarum ii '⁹ (Senot). Cicero De Natura
Deorum, iii. 19, alludes to the devotion of
Erechtheus and his daughters: ‘⁸ Ob eam
ipsam caussam Erechtheus Athenis filiaeque
ejus in numero deorum sunt.”

C. Mucius] The story of Mucius attempt-
ing to kill Porsenna is in Livy (ii. 12), one
of the current stories about the old times
which a man may believe or reject as he
pleases. Cicero of course assumes that peo-
ple did believe it, or he would not have
talked about it3 and they might believe
this story without believing that about
Erechtheus’ daughters, which may be as

true as the other, or as false; it matters
not which.

P. Decius] These are some of Cicero's
‘loci communes! See Livy viii. 93 x. 28.
Manutius observes that Cicero does not
mention the third Decius who fell in the
war against Pyrrhus. But Ferratius replies
that Cicero is speaking of those who de-
voted themselves for their country, and not
of those who merely died in battle (De Fin.
ii. 19). The two Decii appear in the De
ὅρη. c. 20 z ⁴⁶ non duo Decios qui ad volun-
tariam mortem cursum equorum incitave-
runt.⁷'

ipse meminissem] He saw the trouble-
some times of Marius and Cinna, when
P. Crassus, the father of M. Crassus, died
by his own hand, being proscribed by Ma-
rius and Cinna: “Crassus filius ab equiti-
