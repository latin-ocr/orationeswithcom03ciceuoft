430 INTRODUCTION TO THE

answered that they had nothing to do with his house, which was
released from all religious character, but that they¹ related to Seius’
house which Clodius was in possession os after having murdered the
owner-3 sor there were in that house a ‘ sacellum’ and altars, which
were now treated as common things3 and that Clodius' friends too
were in the same case, L. Piso who had got possession of the ‘ sacel-
lum Dianae,’ and Sex. Serranus, who had got possession of several
‘ sacella?

By the third answer about the Oratores he sayS, we must understand
that the ambassadors Theodosius and Plator were pointed at, of whom
Theodosius had been killed by Clodius, and Plator by the treachery of
Piso. In the fourth place he observes that the Fides jurisjurandi was
meant, which had been broken by the J udices, who acquitted Clodius
when 116 was manifestly guilty of ‘ incestus.' And fifthly the wickedness
of Clodius was readily recognized in the fact that he had by an
abominable crime polluted the Sacrificia of the Bona Dea, the most
ancient and mysterious of all the sacrifices.

In like manner the orator explains the warnings from the gods to
apply chiefly to Clodius and those like him; and he says that any mis-
fortunes which threaten the city are owing to Clodius’ wickedness and
rage. In conclusion he apologizes for such a serious and solemn
address, and he exhorts the Senate to the careful performance of religious
duties.

The strange things which are the chief matter of this speech seem
to have happened the year before in the consulship of Cn. Cornelius
Lentulus Marcellinus and L. Marcius Philippus (cc. 6, 7). Dion
speaking of the events under this year says (39. c. 20) : “ In the mean-
time certain wondrous things happened3 for on the Alban mountain a
small shrine of J uno, which was standing on a table towards the east,
turned to the north3 and a torch issuing from the south shot to the
north, and a wolf came into the city, and there was an earthquake3
and some citizens were killed by lightning, and a noise under ground
was heard in the Ager Latinus. The Haruspices wishing to expiate all
this said that some deity was angry with them because certain conse-
crated places were built upon. Clodius on this attaeked Cicero violently
in a speech, on the ground that he had built upon the area of his house
which was dedicated to Libertas; and he once came to the spot with
the intention of again destroying it from the foundation, but he did not
do it, for Milo prevented him.”

Dion says nothing about Cicero having made a speech on this
occasion; and it has also been observed that our orator only mentions
one of the wonderful things which Dion has recorded, and that is the
terrible noise which was heard in the Ager Latiniensis (c. 10).
