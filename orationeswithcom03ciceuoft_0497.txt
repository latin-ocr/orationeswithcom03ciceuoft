VI. De quo quidem tribunatu ita dictum est a Q Hortensio,
ut ejus oratio non defensionem modo videretur criminum continere,
sed etiam memoria dignam juventuti rei publicae capessendae
auctoritatem disciplinamque praescribere. Sed tamen, quoniam
tribunatus totus P. Sestii nihil aliud nisi meum nomen caussamque
sustinuit, necessario mihi de isdem rebus esse arbitror, si non
subtilius disputandum, at certe dolentius deplorandum. Qua in
oratione si asperius in quosdam homines invehi vellem, quis non
concederet, ut eos quorum sceleris furore violatus esser.- vocis
libertate perstringerem? Sed agam moderate et hujus potius

on secure MSS. evidence, had no sense,
and was hardly Latin. However Halm has

changed his mind, for (ed. 2) he has printed
‘ stabula praedari coepisset.' The critics have
proposed many emendations of this passage,
but the text seems at least as good as any.
Writers after Cicero and the poets use
‘praedari ’ with an accusative. 1 do not
know if Cicero does elsewhere. The ¹ sta-
bula’ are the sheep stations on the Apen-
nines. ⁴ Stabulum ’ alone is used to signify
any station or resting-place for traveuers.
Accordingly we find the name ‘Stabula,’
and ⁴ Ad stabulum ’ in the Roman Itinera-
ries. Halm refers to the ‘ stabularii ’ men-
tioned by Ulpian, Dig. 47. 5. l ε “ In eos
qui naves, cauponas, stabula exercent, si
quid a quoque eorum, quos quasve ibi habe-
bant, furtum factum esse dicetur, judicium
datur:” and ξ 6: “namque viatorem sibi
eligere caupo vel stabularius non videtur.''

6. diqnamjuventuti] Madvig's emenda-
tion, founded on the MS. reading ⁴ dignam
uti.’ There can be no doubt about the
emendation being right. Halm refers to
cc. 44, 56, in one of which there is ‘ prae-
claram juventuti ad disoendum3' and to a
letter to Atticus (ii. l).

Qua in oratione] ‘⁶ Cicero could not help
feeling that in the speeches delivered shortly
after his return, I mean the four speeches
which have been declared spuriouS, he had
shown himself rather too violent against
his enemies and opponents‚ and his inten-
tion here is to obviate a false judgment
about what he had said, though in this
speech also he gives his resentment pretty
free scope, by presenting to us the time of
his humiliation nearly in the same way as in
the earlier speeches ” (Klotz). I print this
note because it touches on the question of
the four spurious speeches which Klotz ad-
mires. I leave others to say what the note
is worth.

nouns in the Latin, but Ι do not find an
English word which will do the same. He
