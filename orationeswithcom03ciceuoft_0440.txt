426 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA
defendi, cujusque ignem illum sempiternum non sum passus aut
sanguine civium restingui, aut cum totius urbis incendio com-
misceri; ut, si in illo paene fato rei publicae objeci meum caput pro
vestris caerimoniis atque templis perditissimorum civium furori
atque ferro, et si iterum, quum ex mea contentione interitus bono-
rum omnium quaereretur, vos sum testatus, vobis me ac meos com-
mendavi, meque atque meum caput ea conditione devovi, ut, si et
eo ipso tempore et ante in consulatu meo, commodis meis omni-
bus, emolumentis, praemiis praetermissis, cura, cogitatione, vigiliis
omnibus nihil nisi de salute meorum civium laborassem, tum mihi
re publica aliquando restituta liceret frui; sin autem mea consilia
patriae non profuissent, ut perpetuum dolorem avulsus a meis sus-
tinerem; hanc ego devotionem capitis mei, quum ero in meas sedes
restitutus, tum denique convictam esse et commissam putabO. Nam
1111110 quidem, pontifices, non solum domo, de qua cognoscitis, sed
tota urbe carco, in quam videor esse restitutus. Urbis enim cele-
berrimae et maximae partes adversum illud non monumentum, sed
vulnus patriae contuentur. Quem quum mihi conspectum morte
magis vitandum fugiendumque esse videatis, nolite, quaeso, eum

That is the difference between the two. I
have promised to give no more of Gesner-’s
notes, but Ι cannot- omit this. Iris fair to
show that he understood his writer: “Locus

Nam nunc quidem . . . esse privatum]
Markland could not digest this; and 110
pointed out the absurdity of the opposition
of the ⁴ urbs tota ’ and the ‘urbis partes.’

Such a passage cannot easily be found else-
where. The Dec-laniator says: “ Ι 3111 de-
prived not only of my house, but of the
whole city to which I am supposed to bc
restored. For the most frequented and
greatest parts (in what sense he does not
say) look right in the face, not of that edi-
fice, but of the Patria's wound.”——WVe must
here suppose that though he only appeared
to be restored, 110 was in body in the most
frequented and greatest parts, and that he
was looking from those parts right in the
face of the Patria's wountl.0F0r he con—
tinues, “and since you see that this is a
sight that Ι ought to 5111111 and fly from
worse than death, do not, Ι pray, allow me
to be deprived not only of the honours due
to my rank, but also of parts of the city—-
the most frequented and greatest parts.’'
Markland, who saw the absurdity of the
passage, and said that the man was either
stupid or drunk when he wrote it, did not
however see the meaning; and Gesner did.
The Englishman saw there was nothing in
the sentence but absu1·dity; and he had
not patience to get at the meaning of the
man. The German found out what the
simpleton meant to say; and he admirer] it.

milii videtur inter vehementiae oratoriae
specimina referendus. Verba, nam mmc—
restitutus, non ad verbum, sed figura qua-
dam dicta esse, res ipsa clamat: loquitur
enim in Urbe Tullius. Sed nempe caret re
aliqua, qui illa non fruitur; caret urbe, qui
ea non fruitur, qui discedere malit, quam
adesse etc. Satis hoc declarant quae se-
quuntur 1 Urbis enim celeberrimae et mami-
mae partes (quibus qui caret, 11. 0. abstinet,
ne adspectus dolorem moveat) tota Urbe
videtur carere) adversum illud—esse videa-
tis etc. Sermo est de summo cive, quiin
luce, in foro versari vult, si in Urbe sit, qui
se non putet in Urbe esse, Urbem videre,
si in foro esse sine summo dolore et igno-
minia non liceat.'’ Wolf prints the Eng-
lishman's and the German’s note. He says
nothing.

Mommsen thinks that ‘partibus' is a
glossema. What would the sentence gain
by its omission ? There is every objection
to omitting it, both objections founded on
the form of the sentence and our knowledge
of the writer's style.
