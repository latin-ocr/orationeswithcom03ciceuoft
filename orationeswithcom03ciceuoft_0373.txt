OAP. 6—8. 359

rogatus sum sententiam. Dixi rei publicae saluberrimam, mihi
necessariam. Petebatur a me frumenti copia, annonae vilitas.
Possem aliquid in ea re necne ratio non habebatur. Flagitabar
bonorum expostulatione. Improborum convicia sustinere non
poteram. Delegavi amico locupletiori, non quo illi ita de me
merito onus illud imponerem, succubuissem enim potius ipse, sed
quia videbam id quod omnes, quod nos de Cn. Pompeio pollicere-
mur, id illum fide, consilio, virtute, auctoritate, felicitate denique
sua facillime perfecturum. Itaque sive hunc dii immortales fructum
mei reditus populo Romano tribuunt, ut, quemadmodum discessu
meo frugum inopia, fames, vastitas, caedes, incendia, rapinae,
scelerum impunitas, fuga, formido, discordia fuisset, sic reditu
ubertas agrorum, frugum copia, spes otii, tranquillitas animo-
rum, judicia, leges, concordia populi, senatus auctoritas mecum
simul reducta videantur, sive egomet aliquid adventu meo, consilio,
auctoritate, diligentia pro tanto beneficio populi Romani praestare
debui, praesto, promitto, spondeo. Nihil dico amplius: hoc quod
satis est huic tempori dico, rem publicam annonae nomine in id
discrimen quo vocabatur non esse venturam.

VIII. Num igitur in hoc officio, quod fuit praecipue meum,
sententia mea reprehenditur? Rem maximam fuisse et summi
periculi non solum a fame sed etiam a caede, incendiis, vastitate,
nemo negat, quum ad caussam caritatis accederet iste speculator
communium miseriarum, qui semper in rei publicae malis sceleris

Possem . . . habebatur] I have followed
Baiter here, who has followed ‘ Garatonius
(11) et Klotzius.' This comes as near to
the MSS. as any thing that can be pro-

we know that immediately on his return
there was great scarcity. Pompeius was
appointed to look after the supplies on the
motion of Cicero, who, as the writer has

 

poscd‚ and it is intelligible. In most edi-
tions it stands, ⁴ quasi possem aliquid in ea re
gerenda: non habebatur ς’ where the mean-
ing of ‘non habebatur’ is uncertain. There
seems to be no authority for ⁴ quasi.'

Deleyavi] He referred the Romans for
payment of the demand to one who had
more means than himself. This ‘delegatio’
is the act by which a debtor gives to his
creditor a title to demand his debt from a
debtor of the man ¹ qui delegat.’ Pompeius
owed Cicero a debt. See Pro Fonteio, c.
8, Vol. ΙΙ. note.

Itaque sive] It is hard to say what he
means to affirm in this long sentence. VVheu
he left Rome every thing went with him:
“Mecum leges, mecum quaestiones . . .
mecum etiam frugum ubertas . . . afuerunt”
(Quum Senatui, c. 14). Here the ⁴ uber-
tas agrorum’ returned with him, though

just told us, could do nothing in the diffi-
culty: he transferred the business to the
man who could do it, and who would do it,
as Cicero assured the Romans. To say
then that plenty returned with him, when
scarcity awaited him at Rome3 to say that
his return did that, which he said that he
could not do, the burden of which he trans-
ferred to another, is most absurd. The
critics may torture themselves as they
please: they will never make this consist-
ent.

8. Rem maoez'mam] Ι have taken this
passage as it stands in Baiter. It is cor-
rupt in the common editions, and absurd:
“ Rem maximam eripui a peste summi peri-
culi, non solum eam sed etiam vos a caede.”
The ⁴ res maxima ' is the ‘annona' ‘A fame’
is Halm’s correction, partly founded on c.
10: “ Impendebat fames, incendia‚'' &c,
