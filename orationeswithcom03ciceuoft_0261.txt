rationes conficiendae pecuniae, aut versura aut tributo. Nec tabulae
creditoris proferuntur, nec tributi confectio ulla recitatur. Quam
vero facile falsas rationes inferre et in tabulas quodcunque com-
modum est referre soleant ex Cn. Pompeii litteris ad Hypsaeum, et
Hypsaei ad Pompeium missis, quaeso, cognoscite. LITTERAE
POMPEII ET HYPSAEI. Satisne vobis coarguere his auctoribus dis-
solutam Graecorum consuetudinem licentiamque impudentem vide-
mur? Nisi forte qui Cn. Pompeium, qui praesentem, qui nullo
impellente fallebant, eos urgente Laelio in absentem et in L.
Flaccum aut timidos fuisse aut religiosos putamus. Sed fuerint
incorruptae litterae domi: nunc vero quam habere auctoritatem
aut quam fidem possunt? Triduo lex ad praetorem deferri, judicum
signis obsignari jubet. Tricesimo die vix deferuntur. Ne cor-
rumpi tabulae facile possint idcirco lex obsignatas in publico poni
voluit. At obsignantur corruptae. Quid refert igitur tanto post
ad judices deferantur, an omnino non deferantur?

X. Quid, si testium studium cum accusatore sociatum est, ta-
menne isti testes habebuntur? Ubi est igitur illa exspectatio quae
versari in judiciis solet? Nam antea, quum dixerat accusator
acriter et vehementer, quumque defensor suppliciter demisseque
responderat, tertius 1110 erat exspectatus locus testium, qui aut sine
ullo studio dicebant aut cum dissimulatione aliqua cupiditatis. Hoc

lam habuisse praedandi Flaccum in istis
civitatibus quas invenerit opibus exhaustas
et quae nec versuram fecisse 1100 viritim
titulum contulisse dicantur.⁷'

quodcunque commodum est] ‘ whatever
they please ’ (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 5. 0. 53 Pro
Cluentio, c. 353 De Lege Agraria, i. l).—
‘ Hypsaeum:’ P. Plautius Hypsaeus, Pom-
peius' Quaestor.

incorruptae .. . domi ε] Suppose the
⁸ litterae‚' the written documents which these
111011 have brought to Rome, were not falsi-
fied in Asia. The Lex under which the
prosecution was conducted required such
documents to be brought to the Praetor
within three days after they arrived at
Rome3 but it was near thirty days before
they were brought, as he says. The Lex
required them to be scaled and placed in
some public depository. ‘⁶ Bu‘s‚'’ 110 adds,
“they are scaled when they are already
falsified;'' they are falsified and then they
are sealed. ‘⁴ What matters it then, whe-
ther, after so long an interval, they are
brought to the judices or not brought at
all?” The words ‘at obsignantur cor-
ruptae' are an answer of 1110 orator to the

supposition contained 111 the words ‘sed
fuerint incorruptae litterae domi.’

10. testeum studium] “What, if the
witnesses shall be associated with the pro-
secutor as parfisans, shall such 111οι1 as
these still be considered as witnesses ?‘’ He
represents the witnesses and the prosecutor
as living together; if the witnesses should
make one false step in their evidence (si
verbo titubarint), they will have no lodgings
to go back to. The prosecutor will turn
them loose on the streets. He says of the
pirates in another passage (c. l3): “nihil
esse unde proficiscantur, nihil quo rever-
tantur;” and(1n Cat. iv. 10): “ut etiam
illi qui absunt habeant quo victores rever-
tantur.”

The witnesses generally appeared ⁴ tertio
loco.' The accusator made his charge, then
1110 ‘reus’ by his patronus made his dc-
fence, and then 1110 witnesses were exa-
mined. But sometimes it was not 50. How-
ever this was 1110 general practice, and when
both sides had been heard, people were
eager to see what 1110 evidence would be
(tertius ille erat exspectatus locus testium).
