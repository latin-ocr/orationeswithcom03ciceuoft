ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

exsules Byzantium condemnati tum quum indemnati cives e civitate
ejiciebantur: rex Ptolemaeus, qui, si nondum erat ipse a senatu so-
cius appellatus, erat tamen frater ejus regis, qui quum esset in eadem
caussa, jam erat a senatu honorem istum consecutus, erat eodem
genere isdemque majoribus, eadem vetustate societatis; denique
erat rex, si nondum socius, at non hostis; pacatus, quietus, fretus
imperio populi Romani regno paterno atque avito regali otio per-
fruebatur: dehoc nihil cogitante, nihil suspicante, eisdem operis
suffragium ferentibus est rogatum, ut sedens cum purpura et sceptro
et illis insignibus regiis praeconi publico subjiceretur, et imperante
populo Romano, qui etiam bello victis regibus regna reddere con-
suevit, rex amicus nulla injuria commemorata, nullis rebus repetitis

cum bonis omnibus publicaretur.

emulos] See De Domo, c. 20. Here he
says that the Byzantines were not only exiles,
but that they had been formally con·
‹lemned (c. 39). Halm compares Verr. ii.
5. c. 6: “ Perditae civitates . . . 1105 solent
exitus exitiales habere, ut damnati resti-
tuantur in integrum, vincti solvantur, exules
reducantur.'’

reoePtolemaeu.s·,] De Domo, c. 8. This
is along and rather confused sentence, which
the eritics have explained in various ways.
No doubt the chief idea is ‘ Rex Ptolemaeus

. est publicatus‚’ as Halm observes.
‘Qui quum esset in eadem caussa' is the
Ptolemaeus of Egypt, who, as Manutius
says, “quum meritis in populum Romanum
fratri Cyprio regi non praestaret, sed pari
cum eo conditione esset.'’ Halm cites
Verr. ii. 5. ξ 53; “ Mamertinis qui erant
in eadem caussa:'' whose case was the
same.

Halm (2) writes ‘illum honorem con-
500111115.’ 111 (l), where he has ‘ honorem
istum,' he observes that this is perhaps 311
oblique censure on Caesar and Clodius, who
had fraudulently prevented the king of Cyprus
from receiving the title which his brother
had got through Caesar’s favour (B. C. iii.
107) during his consulship, 13.c. 59.

nullis rebus repetitis] “Without mak-
ing any demand for restitution or compen-
sation.” Halm quotes from Abrami : “ Ita-
que bella et tarde et magna licentia [Nie-
buhr, diliqentia] suscipiebant: quod bellum
nullum nisi pium putabant geri oportere:
priusquam indicerent bellum iis a quibus
injurias factas sciebant, fetiales legatos res
repetitum mittebant quattuor quos oratores
vocabant:” (Varr. apud Non. p. 529,
Merc.). It was the old fashion to demand
satisfaction (res repetere) from an enemy

for any wrong before they proelaimed war.
This was a part of the Jus Fetiale (Vol. Ι.
Verr. ii. 5. 0, 19). Halm refers to 05011-
brueggeu (De J ure Belli et Pacis Romano-
rum, Lipsiae, 1836). Osenbrueggen 1135
collected, I suppose, all that 0311 110 said on
the matter and referred to all the autho-
rities; aud his small treatise 15 useful.
Livy (i. 32) refers the origin of the Jus
Fetiale to the reign of Ancus.
publicaretur] F. A. Wolf (De Domo,
c. 3) had doubted about the expression
‘publicare hominem,' whose mistake Klotz
correctly reproved, vol. iii. p. 943. Cicero
wrote so even in c. 27: add to this Florus
(iii. 9) (Halm).—The passage of Florus
proves nothing. It is true that Cicero
says (c. 27) “ vivus, ut aiunt . . . est pub-
licatus.'’ See De Domo, c. 8, and the
note. If Klotz and Halm are right, this
is an instance iu which those who do not
believe the De Domo to be Cicero's work
are mistaken about the Latinity of this and
the other spurious speeches: and, as Ι 113νο
remarked (p. 299), this may sometimes be
the case. But we can easily see why Cicero
may have used the expression here, even if
it was not a common expression, for he was

speaking of a very uncommon event, and it ,

15 not at all strange for a writer to make
an expression to suit the occasion. This
argument however is as good for the. pas-
sage 111 the De Domo as for this; with this
difference, that the expression is not the
same in both. It is as unusual to say ‘ rex
praeconi publico subjectus est,⁷ as to say
‘rex publicatus est.’ But in these pas-
sages it is ‘rex cum bonis omnibus pub-
lieareturss ‘rex cum victu 30 vestitu suo
publicatus 3' and the addition of the ‘ bona‚’
and the ‘ vietus 30 vestitus ’ makes the ex-
