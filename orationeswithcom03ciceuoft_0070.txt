ORAT. ΙΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

esse facturum ut de periculo publico non ad consilium publicum
rem integram deferrem. Etenim, QuiriteS, si ea quae erant ad me
delata reperta non essent, tamen ego non arbitrabar in tant-is rei
publicae periculis esse mihi nimiam diligentiam pertimescendam.

Senatum frequentem celeriter, ut vidistis, coegi.

Atque interea

statim admonitu Allobrogum C. Sulpicium praetorem fortem virum

quibus ille maximum sicarum numerum et gladiorum extulit.

consilium publicum] The Senate, as it is
sometimes called—‘ad senatum deferri:'
Halm has written ‘ad senatum deferrem’
in the second edition of Orelli. He has
some direct authority for ‘deferrem,' and
the additional authority of the reading
⁴ referrem,’ which occurs in several MSS.
There is also a reading ⁴ rem integram refer-
rem ' at the end of the sentence. Both ⁴ rem
referre ¹ and ‘rem deferre ’ are Latin. But
⁴ rem referre' is the appropriate term for
bringing a matter for consideration before
the Senate3 and ‘rem deferre' is used to
signify the bringing of the insormation. In
Livy (ii. 4) the slave ‘rem ad consules de-
tulit! In the next chapter ‘res integra
refertur ad patres! In some cases it makes
little difference what term is used. Here
⁶ deferre ' is certainly the right word in the
first passage ⁴ ad senatum deferri ;' but Ι
think that in the second it ought to be
‘rem integram referrem.’ For Cicero did
not propose to lay the information before
the Senate; but to refer all the matter to
the Senate. In another passage (In Cat.
iv. 3) he says: ‘⁴ Sed ego institui referre ad
vos, patres conscripti, tamquam integrum ;''
and no various reading is mentioned in this
passage. A little further on (iv, 3) he says:
“ Quantum facinus ad vos delatum sit vide-
tis.’' The distinction between ‘deferre’
and ‘referre’ is maintained in these two
passages.

Senatum—coefi] “Consul Lentulum
quod praetor erat ipse manu tenens per-
ducit; reliquos cum custodibus in aedem
Concordiae venire jubet. Eo senatum ad-
vocat'' (Sallust, Cat. c. 46). The temple
of Concordia was between the Forum and
the Capitolium, close to the Mons Capito-
linus. The greater part of the plan of the
temple is still visible. The foundation of
the temple was laid by M. Furius Camillus

after the reconciliation of the orders in the
State (Plutarch, Camillus, c. 42). Ovid
(Fasti i. 641) :

‘⁶ Nunc bene prospicies Latiam, Concordia,
turbam3
Nunc te sacratae restituere manus.
Furius, antiquum, populi superator Etrusci
voverat, et voti solverat ante fidem.''

4. Vulturcium] Or Voltorcium. (Sal-
lust, Cat. c. 46.) The ‘Fides publica' or
promise of free pardon, could be given, as
it seems, by the Senate. which was the
Roman executive. See Pro C. Rabirio, c.
10. Vol. 11., and Sallust, Cat. c. 47: “post
ubi fide publica dicere jussus, omnia uti
gesta erant aperit (Vulturcius).” ‘ Fides
publica’ is, as Halm observes, the Greek
ᾶόεια. Plutarch (Cicero, c. 19) says: τῷ
Κροτωνιάτῃ ψηφισαμένης ἄξειαν ἐπὶ μη-
νύσει τῆς βουλῆς.

sine timore—ez· mayno timore] ‘Sine
metu ' is the reading of two MSS. only3
Halm. Klotz, who has ‘ sine metu,’ says in
a note on this passage, that ‘metus' is
well-founded sear, as in this instance the
sear of punishment, if the man did not get
a promise of pardon3 and that ‘timor mag-
nus ’ is the man's great alarin without re-
spect to there being any reason for it. Ac-
cordingly this will explain, he says, why in
the Edictum Quod metus caussa, we find
the words “si quis metu perterritus dejectus
fuerit;’' and why Cicero often uses both
‘metus’ and ‘timor' together, as in the
Verrine orations (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 4. c. 19).
There is, it appears, some difference be-
tween ‘metus’ and ‘timon’ There are
however passages in which ‘timor' cer-
tainly does not express sear without refer-
ence to the cause of it, but a sear and a
well-grounded sear too. Horace, Sat. ii 3.
