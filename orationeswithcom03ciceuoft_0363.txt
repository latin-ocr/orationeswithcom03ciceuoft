ORATIO DE DOMO. 349

tificum abrogari. Hoc judicium ad Senatum spectabat, qui de abro-
gandis legibus decernebat, in quibus aliquid peccatum fuisset. Tertio,
argumentum ab adjunctis desumptum debile atque infirmum est. An
impietas Clodii dedicantis impedimento erat, ne rata putaretur dedi-
catio? At de sacris Bonae Deae pollutis absolutus fuerat judicio
publico, et in dedicando rite omnia peregerat. An sanctitas et religio
cujuslibet privatae domus? At Fulvii Flacci aliorumque aedes dedi-
catae videbantur. Au adolescentia Pontfficis, quem in dedicatione ad-
hibuerat? At eum populus comitiis tributis creaverat, et collegium
cooptaverat. An, quia consecratio facta in perniciem civium nulla est,
nulla quoque erit dedicatio? At Cicero non erat civis incolumis, lege
Clodia pulsus in exsilium: si non fuisset exsul, frustra consules ex S.
C. centuriatis comitiis de illo in patriam restituendo tulissent.''

Wolf remarks that this may be considered as said not only against
the commentators, but against the writer of this speech. And the
remark is just3 for it is not easy to believe that Cicero should have
spoken of such a speech as this as one of his best3 a speech in which
it is so difficult to discover the chief argument, and in which so
much is said that is easily answered or refuted, and so much Which is
totally unconnected with the case.

This oration is edited by Baiter in the second edition of Orelli's
Cicero. The following are the MSS. abbreviations :—

C z Codices nostri omnes,

The title of the oration is De Domo sua, in P„ Priscianus, Arusianus
Messius, Servius, Grillius3 De domo sua contra Clodium, in Aquila
Romanus3 De Domo sua apud Pontifices, in Rufinianus; Pro Domo
sua ad Pontifices, in M.: In Clodium, G. V. The best title is In
Clodium, for the abuse of Clodius is the chief thing in it.

I have given the substance of some of Klotz’s notes on this oration.
He has said more on it than on the two orations Quum Senatui, and
Quum Populo; and some of his remarks may be useful. I have given
his meaning as well as I could, wherever I have thought that he ex-
plained a difficulty3 and sometimes for another reason.
