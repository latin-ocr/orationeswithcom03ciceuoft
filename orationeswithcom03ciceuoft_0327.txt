caussa. Quid M. Cispius, cui ego ipsi parenti fratrique ejus sentio

judicio esset offensa, publici mei beneficii memoria privatam offen-

M'. Curtius, cujus ego patri quaestor fui, studio, amore, animo

amicitiae et rei publicae caussa dixit: legem separatim initio de

had done what he could for Cicero.—‘ quam
11011 varius :’ he means, Ι suppose, that 116
was steady in Cicero’s cause.

M. Cispiusfl Cicero afterwards defended
him (Pro Cn. Plancio, 6. 31). Fadius is
mentioned in one of his letters (Ad Fam.
v. 18) ; but when was he Cicero’s quaestor?
Manutius says ‘ in consulatu ;’ and it may be
so (Pro Sestio, c. 3), for a consul had a
quaestor. But he seems to speak ofa quaes-
tor whom a governor 1135111 3 province; and
what follows appears to show that 116 11565 it
SO. But Cicero had not yet taken a province.

M’. Curtius‚] The name is Curius in
some MSS. Μ’. Curtius, a quaestor, is
mentioned 111 1116 01311011 Pro Flacco, 6. 13 ;
and in the letters to Quintus (i. 4), Cicero
mentions Curtius with Sestius, Milo, Fadius,
and Fabricius. We cannot discover who
this Curius or Curtius was, to whose father
Cicero or the Declamator was quaestor.
Cicero was quaestor to Sext. Peducaeus in
Sicily. To ease the difficulty Hotmann
and Pighius suppose that the man was
. adopted by Sext. Peducaeus. But Mark-
land doubts if Cicero ever calls an adoptive
father by the name ¹ pater.’ The explana-
tion is that the statement is false.

Messius] A tribune who is mentioned in
a letter to Atticus (iv. l): “Legem 6011-
511165 60115611ρ561υη1, qua Pompeio per quin-
quennium omnis potestas rei frumentariae
toto orbe terrarum daretur ι alteram Messius,
qui omnis pecuniae dat potestatem et adjun-
git classem et exercitum et majus imperium
in provinciis quam sit eorum qui eas obti-
neant. Illa nostra lex consularis nunc mo-
desta videtur, haec Messii 11011 1’61611(13.”
Cicero never speaks of Messius having pro-
posed a Lex ⁴ de salute mea.²

There is a reading ‘speciatim ’ in place of

‘separatim 3’ but ‘speciatim ⁷ is a barbarous
word, says Wolf, which the most learned
editors since Victorius have turned from
with horror. But there are German editors
since W‘olf’s time, who have printed ⁴ spe-
ciatim’ in the text. Klotz among others
has done it; perhaps to avoid the difficulty
about ‘separatim,' which is explained ‘apart
from his colleagues.’ Then we have, for
the sake of antithesis, in the next chapter,
that L. Caecilius “publice promulgarit de
salute mea cum collegis paene omnibus.'’
Wolf, who was an acute critic and enjoyed a
little fun, which is perhaps allowable 501116-
times, has preserved from oblivion an Edic-
tum of Scheller about ‘speciatim.’ It oc-
curs in his Observatt. in priscos scrippt.
quosdam, p. 104: “Si h. 1. recipitur, est
Ciceronianum: sin minus, non est Cicero-
nianum. Plura vocabula semel tantum oc·
currunt; quae nisi in libros priscorum
(veterum s. antiquorum volebat scribere)
recepta fuissent, non possent in iis hodie
occur1·ere.'' Wolf’s comment is Euge! It
is certainly a choice morsel.

Q. Fabricius,] See Pro Milone, c. 14.

9. L. Caecilius] He 15 mentioned in the
oration Pro Milone, c. 14. M. Calidius is
commemorated by Cicero as an orator
(Brutus, 6. 79). Τ116 terms in which he
describes his art show the wonderful art of
Cicero. In speaking of Calidius' use of
metaphorical language, in which the Ro-
mans delighted much more than the Greek
orators, 116 says: “ac non propria verba
rerum, sed pleraque translata (metaphori-
eally used), sic tamen, ut ea 11011 irruisse 111
alienum locum, sed immigrasse in suum
diceres.'' 11’6 may say of much of our
English metaphor, ‘in alienum locum irruit.'
