manum consulum et principum civitatis interficiendorum caussa

fortunam] Muretus has a long rhetori-
cal note on the meaning of Fortuna, but his
judgment and good sense were not equal to
his skill in turning a phrase. Fortuna was
deified at Rome, like other qualities, and she
had temples. There was a temple of For-
tuna Equestris (Liv, 40. c. 40), of Fortuna
Fortis (Livy, 11). 8. 46; Tacit. 11. c. 41). of
Fortuna Muliebris (Livy, 2. c. 40). The
antientS, says Muretus, meant by Fortuna
nothing else than the ‘ divina voluntas 3'
31111 it is a sign of this, 118 says, that Alcman
called Fortune the sister of J ustice and the
daughter of Providence:

Ὦ Τύχα, Εὐνομίας τε καὶ Πειθοῦς
ἀδελφὰ

Καὶ Προμαθείας Θύγατερ.
Bergk, Poetae Lyrici Graeci, p. 550.

But. he adds that this may be explained dif-
ferently, and may mean that all things suc-
ceed with just and prudent men. So Ι
think. If we had more than the fragment
we might know better what the poet meant.
Muretus concludes that among the ancients
fortune, and perfect wisdom, and reason,
and the soul of the world, and God were all
different names for the same thing; among
the wise, he says3 for he knows that the
vulgar and fools had a very different opinion.
But even the wise did not always so under-
stand Fortuna. Caesar, for instance, who
1135 3 curious remark on Fortuna (B. G. vi.
30), by which he means just what we mean
when we say fortune, chance, without think-
ing any further about the matter than as 3
thing which happens accidentally, as it is
said. The practical rule of life is contained
in the words ‘ Fortes Fortuna adjuvat ;' and
accordingly the Romans built 3 temple to
Fortuna Fortis after a victory over the
Etruscans (Livy, lo. c. 46), near a temple
dedicated to the same goddess by Servius
Tullius. They began early to recognize the
power of Fortuna. Ancus Marcius built the
first temple of Fortuna, as Plutarch says.
Plutarch has a treatise Περὶ τῆς Ἀλεξάν-
&pou Τύχης ἡ Ἀρετῆς, 31111 another Περὶ
τῆς Ῥωμαίων Τύχης. Η8 says, “virtue
and Fortune, which have often had many
great disputes with one another, have the
greatest of all their disputes about the
Roman supremacy, the question being whose
work it is and which of them has engendered
so mighty a power.” 118 311115 (c. 2) : “ For
my part, though Fortune and Virtue have

always been hostile and quarrelling with one
another, Ι think that Ι judge right in con-
cluding, that to effect such a consolidation
of dominion and power, it is probable that
they came together by making truce, and
that then having come together, they per-
fected and laboured together to produce the
noblest of all man‘s works.'' And this
seems to be a very reasonable conclusion of
the old philosopher, and the only way of
settling the question. For it means that
circumstances were favourable to the growth
of the Roman dominion, and that the Ro-
mans had the qualities which enable men to
make the most of their opportunities. The
question is expressed in rather singular
terms, but it is not an idle question. The
great master of Polity‚ Machiavelli, has han-
dled it (Discorsi, ii. c. 1). Plutarch, he
says, and Livy thought that the Romans
owed more to Fortune than to Virtue, but
he is of a different opinion, which he thus
expresses 111 1115 masculine style: “ perche
se non si ὲ trovato mai repubblica, che abbia
fatti i progressi che Roma, ὲ nato che non
si ὲ trovata mai repubblica che sia stata or-
dinata a potere acquistare come Roma.
Perche la virtii degli eserciti gli fecero
acquistare l’imperio, e l'ordine del procedere,
8 11 modo suo proprio, e trovato dal suo
primo Legislatore‚ gli fece mantenere l' ac-
quistato, come di sotto largamente in pih
discorsi si narrera.” He has a chapter in
Il Principe (c. 25) on the power of Fortune
in human things and on the way of opposing
it; and a chapter in the Discorsi (ii. c. 29),
which is very curious: “ Fortune blinds
men’s minds when she does not choose that
they shall oppose her designs.'’ Sallust
says (Cat. c. 8): ⁴· Sed profecto Fortuna in
omni re dominatur: ea res cunctas ex lubi-
dine quam ex vero celebrat obscuratque.'’
He is speaking of Fortune's power in making
men’s acts illustrious 01· obscure. The Athe-
nians did great things, but, as Sallust sup-
poses, not equal to the reputation that they
got. The Athenians had men of talcnt, who
made the exploits of their countrymen pass
for the greatest in the world. Horace 1135
311 ode to Fortuna (i. 37, and the notes in
Mmleane’s e‹l.).

So we speak of chance, of good fortune,
of bad fortune, of l'rovidencc. A word 111-
definite in meaning, used by various people
in various ways, is the outward expression
of the undelined idea of some power which
