486 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

Facilius eorum facta occurrent mentibus vestris, si ora ipsa oculis
proposueritis. ,s

VIII. Alter unguentis affluens, calamistrata coma, despiciens
conscios stuprorum ac veteres vexatores aetatulae suae, puteali et
fenerat-orum gregibus inflatus, a quibus compulsus olim, ne in
Scyllaeo illo aeris alieni tamquam in freto ad columnam adhaeresce-
ret, in tribunatus portum perfugerat, contemnebat equites Ro-
manos, minitabatur senatui, venditabat se operis, atque ab iis se
ereptum ne de ambitu caussam diceret praedicabat, ab isdemque se
etiam invito senatu provinciam sperare dicebat3 eamque nisi

adeptus esset, se incolumem nullo modo fore arbitrabatur.

8. Alter unquentis] Gabinius. His curls
are spoken of in the Quum Senatui, c. 6,
‘ cincinnatus gane0,’ and c. 7, note on ‘ ca-
lamistri!

conscios stuprorum] Drumann, as Halm
remarks, has mistaken the meaning of this
(iii. p. 61, v. p. 668). The Declamator
(Quum Senatui, c. 4) understood it: ‘⁴ Quo-
rum alter a me Catilinam amatorem suum
multis audientibus . . . reposcebat.’'

puteali . . . inflatu-sd ‘Inflatus ' is ex-
plained as equivalent to ⁴ iratus.' Halm
cites another example from Livy 24. c. 32;
but it seems doubtful if that is the meaning
of ⁴ inflati’ in that passage. The words
‘ puteali ’ and ⁴ gregibus ’ cannot be the ab—
lative, for if they were, we must take ‘ pu-
teali inflatus’ to be an expression of tbe
same form as ‘ spe inflatus ’ and the like;
and there is no sense in saying that he ‘ in-
flated with or by the Puteal' and so forth.
Accordingly it is concluded that ‘ puteali'
and ‘ gregibus ' are datives3 and it is said
to mean ‘ puffed up against,’ ‘ arrogant to-
wards,’ and so on. The passage of Horace
(i. Sat. l. v. 20), where we have

quin illis Jupiter ambas
Iratus buccas inflet ”

 

is quoted by Klotz. Still ‘ alicui inflatus '
is not quite the same. On the ‘puteal
Libonis’ (Hor. Ep. i. 19, 8) Porphyrius
says: ‘⁵ Puteal autem Libonis sedes prae-
toris fuit prope arcum Fabianum, dictum-
que quod a Libone illic primum tribunal et
subsellia locata sint.'' The Schol. on Persius,
Sat. iv. 49, says : “ Foeneratores ad puteal
Scribonis Licinii (Scribonii Libonis), quod
est in porticu J ulia ad Fabianum arcum, con-
sistere solebant.'’ Macleane's Hor. S. ii. 6. 35.

Scyllaeo] The Scyllaeum is a high rock
in the form of a peninsula, not far from
Caenys on the sti-ait between Italy and
Sicily. Caenys is the point of Italy oppo-

Alter,

site to Pelorus in Sicily. Between Caenys
and Rhegium is the Columna Regina or
Posidonium (Strab. p. 257). We see now
what Cicero means. He says ‘ lest in that
Scyllaeum of debt, as if he were in the
straits, he should stick to the column!
The column is supposed to be the Maenia:
‘⁴ nam puteal vocabatur locus in vicinia
fori, ubi erat columna Maenia apud quam
debitores a creditoribus proscribebantur ’'
(Schol. Vatia). The confusion between the
strait and the Columna Regina, for it is
rather confusion than comparison, and the
debt and the Maenia is not in good taste.
Gabinius protected himself against his cre-
ditors by getting the tribunate, for his cre-
ditors could not trouble him during his year
of office. Compare Quum Senatui, c. 5.

insreto] ⁴ in fretu’ P¹.‚ Halm (2). Both
forms, it seems, were used. See Vol. Ι. Verr.
ii. 5. c. 66. and the note on ‘ fretu-¹

de ambitu] “Gabinius was prosecuted
for Ambitus after his return from his pro-
vince, as appears from Cicero, Ad Q. Fr.
iii. 3, and Ad Att. iv. 16” (Garatoni).
Cicero says in the letter to his brother
(B.c. 54): “Gabinium de ambitu reum
fecit P. Sulla.'’ It seems that Gabinius was
p.osecuted in B c. 54 both for Majestas,
Repetundae, and Ambitus. See Quum Po-
pulo, c. 4, note on ‘ gratiae caussa.'

invito senatu] Ferratius observes that no
man was elected consul without having a
province first assigned to him, and this was
the practice since the time os the Sempronia
Lex of C. Gracchus. But Gabinius with
the assistance of Clodius got the province
of Syria against the will of the senate. As
to his not being ⁴ incolumis,’ unless he got
the ‘ provincia‚' which he wanted, it is plain,
as Halm observes, that the orator means
that this was the only way of repairing his
ruined fortunes.

Alter,] Piso, who wore a beard like the
