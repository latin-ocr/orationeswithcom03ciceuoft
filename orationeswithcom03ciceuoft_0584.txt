570 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

mus, qui incitarunt aliquando populi animos ad seditionem, aut qui
largitione caecarunt mentes imperitorum, aut qui sortes et claros
viros et bene de re publica meritos in invidiam aliquam vocaverunt.
Leves hos semper nostri homines et audaces et malos et perniciosos
cives putaverunt. At vero qui horum impetus et conatus repres-
serunt, qui auctoritate, qui fide, qui constantia, qui magnitudine
animi consiliis audacium restiterunt, hi graves, hi principes, hi
duces, hi auctores hujus dignitatis atque imperii semper habiti sunt.

LXVII. Ac ne quis ex nostro aut aliquorum praeterea casu
hanc vitae viam pertimescat, unus in hac civitate, quem quidem
ego possim dicere, praeclare vir de re publica meritus, L. Opimius,
indignissime concidit; cujus monumentum celeberrimum in foro,
sepulchrum desertissimum in littore Dyrrachino relictum est.
Atque hune tamen flagrantem invidia propter interitum C. Gracchi
semper ipse populus Romanus periculo liberavit: alia quaedam
civem egregium iniqui judicii procella pervertit. Ceteri vero aut

hujus (Iiynilatis alque imperii] Guliel-
mius proposed ἴς write ‘hujus civitatis.
atque imperii‚’ and Wesenberg approves os
this, maintaining that the notion of‘ dignitas '
is foreign to this passage, “in which we
have tnrbulent men on one side, who are
always considered ‘perniciosi cives,’ and
on the other their opponents, who are con-
sidered the chief of the ‘optimates' and
⁴ auctores et conservatores civitafisss as they
are called at the beginning of this chapter.'’
Ido not see why Cicero cannot call them
‘auctores hujus dignitatis,' as well as
‘auctores imperii,' the men “to whom we
owe all this honourable estate and this
empire.”

is Madvig's correction, which Halm will not
accept. The MSS„ perhaps all, have ‘ pos-
sum‚' but Ascensiana tertia and Hervagius
have ‘possi1n.’ Madvig makes the neces-
sity for the subjunctive depend, partly at
least, so far as Ι understand him, on the
‘ quidem.’ Cicero says “ only one man in
the state, so far as I can recollect.” He
does not mean to say “ one man in the
state, and I can tell you his name.'’

L. Opimins‚] The murderer of C. Grac-
chus, B.c. 121 (Plutarch, C. Gracchus. c.
16 ς Quum Populo, c. 5). The critics have
not been agreed what his ‘ monumentum in
foro’ was. Some thought that it was the
temple of Concordia, which was erected in
the Forum to commemorate Opimius’ ser-
vices (Plutarch, C. Gracchus, c. 17; Ap-
pian, B. C. i. 26). Manutius supposed that

the ‘ monumentum ' was a Basilica. Becker
(Handbuch, &c.‚ 1309) doubted if there
was a Basilica Opiniia; but Urlichs (Rb-
mische Topographie in Leipzig. p. 26) be-
sides Varro's evidence for a Basilica Opi-
mia (L. L. v. 156, ed. Misit), quotes two
inscriptions from Marini's Atti de’ fratelli
Arvali, p. ⁶212, in which ⁴ Basilica Opimia '
occurs. Becker in his answer to this pam-
phletv of Urlichs (Zur Romischen Topogra-
phie, p. 33) acknowledges his mistake. Ile
had overlooked the two inscriptions in Ma-
r1n1.

iniqnijudicii procella] He has said that
the ‘populus Romanus’ always protected
Opimius. Liv. Epit. 61: “L. Opimius
accusatus apud populum a Q. Decio tr. pl.
quod indemnatos cives in carcerem conje-
cisset absolutus est.'' Opimius was prose-
cuted 13.c. 120 on a charge of Mnjestas,
founded on his violence in putting down
C. Gracchus and his partizans. C. Papi-
rius Carbo the consul defended him. Opi-
mius was afterwards tried under a Lex
Mamilia for liis miscenduct as a legatus in
the matter of the division of Numidia <B.c.
112). He was charged with being bribed
by ,Iugurtha (Sall. Jug. c. 16), convieted,
and sent into exile (sc. 110). He was
convicted, as Cicero says, because of his
unpopularity owing to the affair of Grae-
chus, and the Equites, who at this time
were thejudices οι· court, paid offin this way
an old grudge (Cicero, Pro Cn. Plancio, c.
28; Brutus, c. 34: Sallust, Jug. c. 40).
Opimius died in poverty at Dyrrachium
