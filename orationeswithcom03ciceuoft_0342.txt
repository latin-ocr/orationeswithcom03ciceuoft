328 INTRODUOTION TO THE

in his hands, and that a Lex should be proposed to the people. When
the Senatusconsultum was read and Cicero’s name was heard, the
people applauded, and Cicero made them a speech (habui contionem).
He does not say what he spoke about, nor was it necessary to tell us,
for we assume that he spoke about the matter of the Senatusconsultum.
Those critics‚ whose judgment is sound, say that he does not here
mean the Contio to the Quirites, in which he thanked them, but he
means a speech about the price of provisions, and those matters. There
is nothing in this letter about the present speech or the subject of it3
and though this omission is not evidence that he did not deliver such a
speech, the letter contains no evidence that he did. Feri-acci assumes
that the Contio which Cicero speaks of is this speech in which 116
thanked the people. Those who will read the letter carefully may form
their own judgment.

It is urged that it was natural that Cicero should address the people
and thank them for their votes by which the Lex was carried which
restored him to Rome. This must be admitted. But why did he not
thank them sooner than before the seventh of September, the day which
is assigned by some critics as the day on which this oration was delivered
(Ad Att. iv. 1) Ρ It may be that he could not get the permission of the
magistratus to do it sooner3 for 116 says of the‘Contio which he did
make on the occasion of the Senatusconsultum: “habui contionem:
omnes magistratus praesentes praeter unum praetorem et duos tribunos
pl. dederunt.’' “ If it had been,⁷' says Klotz, “another occasion than
his own on which Cicero wished to speak, he would not have expressly
added these words, in which he points at the magistrates who were his
political enemies.’' But 116 spoke on the occasion of the S. C. being
read and his own name mentioned, and if he took this opportunity of
thanking the people instead of speaking of the S. O, 116 did not act like
a prudent man. He might have thanked the pcople, and spoken of the
price of provisions -too3 but he says nothing of the scarcity in this
speech. Klotz says he omitted to do so because there was no occasion
to speak of it. There is no replying to some arguments except by
making the contrary assertion. The Scholiast published by Mai takes
this to be a genuine oration of Cicero. He says, ‘⁶ Restitutus M. Tullius,
quod eandem causam beneficii videbat in suam dignitatem prope om-
nium favore conlati, quum grates egisset senatui, etiam populo conse-
quenter gratias agendas arbitratus, in contionem processit3 et eadem
paene, quae apud patres conscriptos dixerat, nunc etiam populo audiente
percenset.''

Klotz fixes the date of this speech two days after the address to the
Senate, and he says that this would be the seventh of September. Wolf
does not admit that it could have been delivered 8 Idus Sept„ as some
