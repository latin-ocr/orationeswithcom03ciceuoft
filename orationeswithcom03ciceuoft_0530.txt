516 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

de vita ejus viri et civis timentibus, ipse animo firmissimo venit in
templum, et clamorem hominum auctoritate, impetum improborum
virtute sedavit. Adiit tum periculum, sed adiit ob eam caussam,
quae quanta fuerit jam mihi dicere non est necesse. At si isti
Cypriae rogationi sceleratissimae non paruisset, haereret illa nihilo
minus rei publicae turpitudo: regno enim jam publicato de ipso
Catone erat nominatim rogatum. Quod ille si oepudiasset, dubi-
tatis quin ei vis esset allata, quum omnia acta illius anni per unum
illum labefactari viderentur? Atque etiam hoc videbat: quoniam
illa in re publica macula regni publicati maneret, quam nemo jam
posset eluere, quod ex malis boni posset in rem publicam pervenire,
id utilius esse per se conservari quam per alios. Atque ille, etiam
si alia quapiam vi expelleretur illis temporibus ex hac urbe, facile

pateretur.

⁶ nobilitas' opposed Metellus, 31111 particularly
his colleaguc Cato. Caesar, who was prae-
tor (13.c. 62), sided with Metellus (Schol.).

Manutius tries to prove that this templum
was the Rostra, for the Rostra were also
called Templum (Liv. viii. 14). Halm
thinks that it may be the temple of Castor,
“ castellum forensis latrocinii'’ ([11 Ρ15011. c.
5). Plutarch (Cato Minor. c. 27) also says:
“XVhen Cato stopped and saw the temple
of the Dioscuri surrounded by armed men
and the steps gnarded by gladiators, and
Metellus himself with Caesar sitting above,
110 turned to his friends and said, ⁴ O the
dai-ing and cowardly men, to collect such a
force of soldiery against a single man un-
armed and defenceless.’ ¹' Besides, as Halm
observes, ‘ venit in templum ’ 11103115 what
the words say, ⁸ he went into 1110 temple,'
not on the Rostra.

sed adiit ob eam caussam‚] ⁴‘ Pruden-
tissime suppressit mentionem legum quas
Metellus de Pompeio tulerat, 110 ipsum
scil. offenderet, de quo latae videbantur '’

(801101.). Halm adds the following from
Abrami: “Bene addidit ob eam causam
etc. ; nam nisi honesta causa subsit adeundi
periculi, nulla est fortitudo.’' But this is
not the explanation. The Scholiast has
given it. Besides, is there no ⁴ fortitudo ’ in
a bad cause ? ‘ Fortitudo' is made perfect
by ‘temperantia' (Tuscul. v. 14). Itis worse
than waste oftime to copy suchanote. When
it is once put in circulation‚ it may be use-
ful to warn people against the false coin.
What Halm adds is more to the purpose:
Cicero wished to show that Cato could and
did resist unjust Rogationes when he

Etenim, qui superiore anno senatu caruisset, quo si tum

thought that his country’s weal required it.
And so this is the apology which he dexter-
ously prepares for Cato's Cyprian mission,
which he now comes to. ⁴ At si isti,' &c.

per mmm illum] Cato, as Ferratius says,
tho only man who seemed to be able to re-
sist Clodius. Why did 110 not rcsist then?

conservari quam per alios] Cato saw
that the Cyprian king was to be plundered.
The crime was to be committed. But some
good would come out of it: the treasury
would get all that the king had, and Cato
thought it better for the plunder to be
saved by himself than by others. Some of
the critics think that an infinitive verb has
been lost after ‘per alios,’ such a word as
‘‹liripi‚’ ⁴ amitti,’ and the like. Each man
must judge for himself. When Cicero says
that Cato thought it was better for him to
look after the plunder than for others, no-
body ought to find it obscure.

svper-iore mmo] Β c. 59, in Caesar's con-
sulship, during which, as he sayS‚ Cato did
not come to the meetings of the Senate.
Plutarch (Cat. Min. c. 32, 33) has some-
thing about Cato's opposition to Caesar in
his consulship. Cicero tells us plainly in
what follows that he was driven out of
Rome before Cato went on his honourable
mission (c. 28). Cato might have followed
his friend⁷s example, and so have avoided
the scandal of the Cyprian business.

He makes Cato's 0350 and his own very
much alike. Cato was the man who turned
the wavering Senate to the bold and whole-
some counsel of getting rid of the conspi-
rators, whom they had caught3 and the
attack on Cicero the consul of that year

was a condemnation of Cato’s vote about

the conspirators.
