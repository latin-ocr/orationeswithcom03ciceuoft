492 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

Venistis ad senatum, vos, inquam, equites Romani, et omnes boni
veste mutata vosque pro meo capite ad pedes lenonis impurissimi
projecistis. Tum vestris precibus ab latrone illo repudiatis, vir
incredibili fide, magnitudine animi, constantia, L. Ninnius, ad sena-
tum de re publica rettulit senatusque frequens vestem pro mea salute
mutandam censuit.

XII. O diem illum, judices, funestum senatui bonisque omnibus,
rei publicae luctuosum, mihi ad domesticum maerorem gravem, ad
posteritatis memoriam gloriosum! Quid enim quisquam potest
ex omni memoria sumere illustrius quam pro uno cive et bonos
omnes privato consensu et universum senatum publico consilio
mutasse vestem? quae quidem tum mutatio non deprecationis
caussa est facta, sed luctus Quem enim deprecarere, quum omnes
essent sordidati quumque hoc satis esset signi esse improbum, qui
mutata veste non esset? Hac mutatione vestis facta, tanto in
luctu civitatis, omitto quid ille tribunus, omnium rerum divinarum
humanarumque praedo, fecerit, qui adesse nobilissimos adolescentes,
honestissimos equites Romanos, deprecatores salutis meae jusserit
eosque operarum suarum gladiis et lapidibus objecerit: de con-
sulibus loquor, quorum fido res publica niti debuit. Exauimatus
evolat ex senatu, non minus perturbato animo atque vultu quam si
annis ante paucis in creditorum conventum incidisset3 advocat
contionem, habet orationem talem consul qualem numquam Catilina

the Quum Senatui, &c.; and the Quum
Senatui, c. 2, note3 and Ad Att. iii. 23.
Dion, quoted above, says (38. c. 16) that
Ninnius advised (παρῄνεσε) the people
to put on the dress of mourning. Manu-
tius makes Dion say that Ninnius persuaded
them (persuasit). See the Quum Populo,
c. 3, about the twenty thousand. In the
next chapter he says “ bonos omnes . . .
mutasse veste1n,’' which Ferratius supposes
to be said ‘oratorie,' that is, falsely. He
also quotes the passage from Plutarch, Cicero
(e. 31), and from the Quum Populo, to show
that it was the Equites not the Plebs who
changed their dress. But Drumann (ii. p.
244) denies that Plutarch proves what Fer-
ratius says, for after speaking of the ¹ twenty
thousand' Plutarch adds : ‘⁴ when the Senate
had met in order to pass a vote that the
people should change their dress as in a

The story is told in the De Domo, c. 21:
“Quum eos qui conventu,'' &c.; and in
Dion Cassius, 38. c. 16, who says that
Gabinius brought a charge against Horten-
sius and Curio, two senators, because they
had joined the ‘equites ’ in their meeting,
and undertaken to act as their spokesman3
and Clodius having brought them before
the popular assembly had them well beaten
for undertaking this business by some men
who were hired for the purpose. Compare
In Pison. c. 10. This is Halm’s explana-
tion: some of the commentators have mis-
understood the passage.
