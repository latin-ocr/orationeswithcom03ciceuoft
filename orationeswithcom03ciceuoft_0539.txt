CAP. 34, 35. 525

Quid illi, quorum consilio P. Sestius in judicium vocatur, quo se
pacto gerunt? Quum forum, comitium, curiam multa de nocte
armatis hominibus ac servis plerisque occupavissent, impetum
faciunt in Fabricium, manus afferunt, occidunt nonnullos, vulnerant
multos. Venientem in forum virum optimum et constantissimum,
M. Cispium, tribunum plebis, vi depellunt; caedem in foro maxi-
mam faciunt3 universique destrictis gladiis et cruentis in omnibus
fori part-ibus fratrem meum, virum optimum, fortissimum meique
amantissimum, oculis quaerebant, voce poscebant. Quorum ille
telis libenter in tanto luctu ac desiderio mei non repugnandi, sed
moriendi caussa corpus obtulisset suum, nisi suam vitam ad‘ spem
mei reditus reservasset. Subiit tamen vim illam nefariam consce-
leratorum latronum, et quum ad fratris salutem a populo Romano
deprecandam venisset, pulsus e rostris in comitio jacuit seque ser-
vorum et libertorum corporibus obtexit vitamque tum suam noctis
et fugae praesidio, non juris judiciorumque defendit. Meministis
tum, judices, corporibus civium Tiberim compleri, cloacas referciri‚
e foro spongiis effingi sanguinem, ut omnes tantam illam copiam
et tam magnificum apparatum non privatum aut plebeium, sed
patricium et praetorium esse arbitrarentur.

rectly translates it: “he makes no first
step, does not take the initiative at all ;”
and he compares Livy 31. c. l: “ quidquid
progredior.'' ‘⁴ Ad nihil prom-esst, quod
Orelli dicendum fuisse putat, Latine non
dicitur, ad nihilum tantum certo modo.
Ideo dixit nihil proyredz' i. e. in nulla re.-
sic enim fere (vel ad nullam rem) intelligi
nihil potest, ubi pro non ponitur’' (Mad-
vig). ⁴ Ad omnia progredientes ' occurs in
the De Harusp. c. 26.

forum, comiliurm] Halm refers to Becker,
Rom. Alterthiim. i. p. 275 ι “ It is an en-
tirely erroneous assumption of those who
suppose the Comitium to be a building or
at least a space roofed over and surrounded
with pillars. It is rather a part of the
Forum itself, which received the name from
its political destination‚ while the other
part which was appropriated to other busi-
ness is simply called Forum, and thc name
denotes also both, the whole α’γορά. Ac-
cordingly the Comitium is often opposed to
the Forum, and the former is named as the
most important part of the Forum (Cicero,
Pro Sestio, e. 35 ; Livy 34. c. 45 3 Sueton.
Caesar, c. 10). It is an open uncovered
place, like the rest of the Forum, as appears
from this, that troops passed through it,
that it rained blood and milk on it (Livy

34. c. 45), that the sacred Ficus Ruminalis
stood there (Tacit. Ann. xiii. c. 58), and
even the Rostra (Pro Sestio, c. 35: ‘pulsus
e Rostris in Comitio jacuit‘) ; and above all,
how could a place where popular meetings
(contiones) were held. which were addressed
from the Rostra, have been covered (Livy
10. c. 243 3. c.10‚ 11ς 3. c. 33) ?’'

multa de nocte] See Pro Murena, e. 9,
note on ‘de nocte! Here it means that a
good deal of the night remained (Halm).

destrictis] Garatoni (cited by Halm)
says that ‘ destrictis ¹ is the only true form.
Halm thinks that ⁴ districtis ’ is altogether
to be condemned. Ι think not. See Caesar,
B. G. i. 25, and Schneider’s note.

jacuit] He was wounded and fell, which
seems to be the meaning, but the men about
him protected him. Plutarch (Cicero, c.
33) may have had this passage before him
and misunderstood it, for he says, “ Quin-
tus, the brother of Cicero, only escaped
by lying among the bodies as if he were
dead.‘'

,symnyiis effinyi] ‘Wipedupwith sponges‚'
as Servius explains it (Ad Aen. viii. 634).
P. G. have ‘ effundi ’ (Halm).

apparatum] The ⁴ apparatus ’ is the
preparation for this right, which he calls
‘ magnificus,’ alluding to the Praetor Ap-
