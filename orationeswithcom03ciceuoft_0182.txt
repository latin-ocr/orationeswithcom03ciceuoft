168 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

judicio sed 1110ος 51 hoc tibi dem, quod credi non potest, nisi ego
huic adessem, 1105 adfuturos non fuisse 3 uter tandem rex est, isne
cui innocentes homines non resistunt, an is qui calamitosos non
deserit? At hic etiam, id quod tibi necesse minime suit, facetus
esse voluisti, quum Tarquinium et Numam, et me tertium peregri-
num regem esse dixisti. Mitto jam de rege quaerere: illud quaero,
peregrinum cur me 0550 dixeris. Nam si ita sum, non tam est admi-
randum regem esse me, quoniam, ut tu vis, etiam peregrini reges
Rornae fuerunt, quam consulem Romae fuisse peregrinum. Hoc
dico, inquit, te esse ex municipio. Pateor, et addo etiam, ex eo
municipio unde iterum jam salus huic urbi imperioque missa est.
Sed scire ex te pervelim, quamobrem qui ex municipiis veniant pere-

ment of their own.

pereyrinmn] Numa according to the old
story was a Sabine, and Tarquinius Priscus
was an Etruriam, a Peregrinus, an alien at
Rome. There was not much point in taunt-
ing Cicero with being a Peregrinus, which
he was not, or he conld not have been 0011-
5111. Η15 native place Arpinum, also the
birthplace of C. Marius, whom he speaks of
as one of the saviours of Rome, was a town
near the Liris. It became a dependency on
Rome in B.c. 302, and in Β.0. 188 it had
the Roman ‘ civitas,’ or as Livy (38. c. 36)
says, ‘the ‘⁴ suflragii 10110, 110111 011ῒο 51110
suffragio habuerant eivitatems' But the Ro-
man ⁴ civitas 51110 suffragio,' which means
without the capacity to enjoy the ‘ho-
noreS‚' was not a ‘civitas 3' it was one of
the forms of dependence on Rome. As
Arpinum was an old Italian town, it was a
‘ municipium ’ with reference to Rome both
before and aster it had the ⁶ civitas,’ though
its political condition was altered by having
the ⁴ civitas.'—‘ ut tn ais,’ T. Halm.

qui—veniant] ⁴ Men from a municipium.y
This is the Roman form of expression, when
a thing is said generally, when the predica-
tion is subordinate to that which is predi*
cated by the principal verb 111 the sentence.
So 110 says (Pro Plancio, c. 27), “ 1110 unum
ex iis feci qui ad aquas venissent.”

M. illi Catoni] This old Cato the Censor

fight with his political enemies. Four and
forty times, says Pliny (vii. 27), this bold
and active man had to defend himself iu
court, and four and forty times he was ac-
quitted. He was, says Pliny, a most ex-
cellent orator, commender, and senator;
and he might have added a good farmer,
and every thing3 a man of more than usual
Roman varied talent. Livy (39. c. 40) has
a passage about him which is worth read-
ing.

Ti. Coruncanius, the first Plebeian who
was elected Pontifex Maximus, is said by
Cicero (Pro Plancio, c. 8) to have come
from Tusculum. But the emperor Claudius
in a speech reported by Tacitus (Anu. xi.
24) says that he was of Camerium, re·-
marking at the same time that the Porcii
were of Tusculum. Halm prefers this tes-
timony to Cicero’s, of whom he remarks
that he is not seldom inexact and careless
in historical matters.

M'. Curius Dentatus triumphed over king
Pyrrhus Itis not known what his native
place was. Cicero could trnly say that when
Torquatus reproached him with coming from
a ‘municipium.’ it. was a reproach that was
applicable to the greatest part of the citi-
zens. Rome in its origin had only a few
square miles of territory, and the Romanae
coloniae occupied only a very small part of
Italy. Most ofthe Roman citizens of Cicero’s
time were not Romans.
