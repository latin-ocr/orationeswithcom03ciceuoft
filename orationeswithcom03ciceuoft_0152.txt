138 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA
humanitatis. ‘⁴ In sententia permaneto.” Vero, nisi sententiam

alia vicerit melior. Hujuscemodi Scipio ille fuit, quem non poeni-
tebat facere idem quod tu ς habere eruditissimum hominem Panae-
tium domi, cujus oratione et praeceptis, quamquam erant eadem
ista quae te delectant, tamen asperior non est factus, sed, ut accepi
a senibus, lenissimus. Quis vero O. Laelio comior? quis jucundior
eodem ex studio ist03‚q11is illo gravior, sapientior? Possum de
L. Philo, de C. Gallo dicere haec eadem : sed te domum jam dedu-
cam tuam. Quemquamne existimas Catone, proavo tuo, commo-
diorem, communiorem, moderatiorem fuisse, ad omnem rationem
humanitatis? de cujus praestanti virtute quum vere graviterque
diceres, domesticum te habere dixisti exemplum ad imitandum.
Est illud quidem exemplum tibi propositum domi3 sed tamen
naturae similitudo illius ad te magis qui ab illo ortus es quam ad
unum quemque nostrum pervenire potuit: ad imitandum vero tam

which may here be expressed by ⁴ yes ι’ ‘ yes
some, not all ς’ ‘ yes, resist favour when
duty and good saith shall require it! To
the third, ‘⁴ Be not moved by compassion,''
the answer is still a concession, Yes3 but
the words which follow are obscure. Halm
rewrites it thus: ‘⁶ Etiam3 sed tamen in
dissolvenda severitate est laus aliqua huma-
nitatis.'’ But the text is the MSS. reading,
and it may mean, as Manutius says z ‘⁴ Yes,
be not 111ονθεί by compassion to the dissolu-
tion of severity3 but,'’ &e.—‘ nisi sententiam
sententia alia vicerit melior :' this is the
reading of several MSS„ followed by Halm.

Panaetium doma] One of the Lagomar-
sini MSS. The other readings are ¹ et
paene (livinum,’ ‘et paene domi‚’ and other
varieties. The Stoic Panaetius lodged with
Scipio Africanus the younger. lt was the
fashion for distinguished Romans to keep
Greek philosopher-s in their houses. Cicero
had Diodotus with him, and kept him 111 1115
1101156 for many years, till he died (Acad. ii.
3113 Brutus, 6. tw). Panaetius had the
merit of being 3 61631· writer, and we may
perhaps infer that he was a good teaeher.
1115 work De Officiis (περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντυς)
was the foundation of Cicero's treatise (De
Off. iii. 23 Ad Ait. xvi. ll): “Panaetius
igitur quisine controversia (16 officiis accura-
tissime disputavit quemque nos correctione
quadam adhibita potissimum set-uti sumus.''

C. Laelio] The friend of Scipio the
vounger, who also cultivated philosophy
'(1’1·0 Arvhia. 6. 7). Cicero has 6111111611 his
discourse on Friendship ‘Laelius-‚⁷ sor Lae.
lius, the friend of the younger Africanus, is
the chief speaker 111 1116 dialogue.

L. Phila] The MSS. have L. Philippo,

but it is probably a mistake. Manutius
made the correction. Philippus was an
orator (Brutus, 6. 47), of whom Cicero says :
‘⁸ Summa libertas in oratione, multae face-
tiae3 satis creber in reperiendis, solutus in
explicandis sententiis, erat enim imprimis,
ut temporibus illis, Graecis doctrinis in-
stitutus.'' Horace (Ep. i. 7) has a story
about him which is an example of his
‘facetiae' L. Furius Philus is mentioned
in the oration Pro Archia with Laelius. He
was a man of good character and great ac-
quirements: ‘⁴ P. Afficano, C. Laelio, L.
Furi0‚ qui secum eruditissimos homines
ex Graecia palam semper habuerunt.'' The
correction of Manutius seems to be certain.

C. Sulpicius Gallus was an astronomer‚
and in the war against Perses, king of Ma-
cedonia (11.6. 187), 116 predicted an eclipse,
and told the soldiers not to be afraid of
it (Livy, 44. c. 37 ; De Senectute, c. 14).

communiorem] There is also a reading
‘ comiorem.’ Cicero often uses ‘ communis,'
as in De Sen c. 17: ‘ communem erga Ly-
sandrum,' if the reading is right: and De
Am. c. 18; Η81111111166111 praeterea et com-
munem et consentientem qui rebus iisdem
moveatur eligi par est.’' Communis is one
who puts himself on a footing of equality
with others. 501116 crities have preferred
⁴ eomiorem ’ in this passage, because it is
said that ‘eommunis' is not used 111 the
comparative, except in this example (Ad
Fam. iv. a) : “ Ε11111 magis communem cen-
semus in victoria futurum fuisse quam incer-
tis in rebus fuisset.’'—‘ qui ab τ’ ‘quoniam
ab,’ Halm.
