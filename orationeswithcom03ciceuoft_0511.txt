OAP. 14, 15. 497
rogatione quis est qui non intelligat universam rem publicam esse
deletam? Isdemque consulibus inspectantibus servorum delectus
habebantur pro tribunali Aurelio nomine collegiorum, quum vicatim
homines conscriberentur, decuriarentur, ad vim, ad manus, ad cae- >
l dem, ad direptionem incitarentur. Isdemque consulibus arma in
templum Castoris palam comportabantur, gradus ejusdem templi
tollebantur: armati homines forum et contiones tenebant, caedes
lapidationesque fiebant: nullus erat senatus, nihil reliqui magistra-
tus: unus omnem omnium potestatem armis et latrociniis possi-
debat, non aliqua vi sua, sed quum duo consules a re publica pro-
vinciarum foedere retraxisset, insultabat, dominabatur, aliis pollice-
batur, terrore ae metu multos, plures etiam spe et promissis tenebat.
Quae quum essent ejusmodi, judiees, quum senatus duces nullos ac
pro ducibus proditores aut potius apert-os hostes haberet, equester
ordo reus a consulibus citaretur, Italiae totius auctoritas repudia-
retur, alii nominatim relegarentur, alii metu ac periculo terrerentur,
arma essent in templis, armati in foro, eaque 11011 silentio consulum
dissimularentur, sed et ⁴voce et sententia comprobarentur3 quum
omnes urbem nondum excisam et eversam, sed jam captam atque

oppressam videremus, tamen his tantis malis tanto bonorum studio,

deletam ?] It is plain what he means :
that if the Auspicia and the religious cere-
monial were taken away, the state was
destroyed, for religion was one of the
foundations of the Roman state. Halm
refers to In Vatin. 6. 9: ‘⁵ qui primum
eam rem publicam, quae auspiciis inventis
constituta est, iisdem auspiciis sublatis
conarere evertere ;” and he says, In Vatin.
c. 7, of the Leges Aelia and Fufia: “ quae
leges saepenumero tribunitios furores de-
bilitaverunt ac represserunt.”

pro tribunali Aurelio] Before and about
ι 1116 tribunal Aurelium, which was a stone
edifice in the Forum surrounded by steps,
the ‘Aurelii gradus! See De Domo,
c. 21.

nomine colleqiormm] As belonging to
the several ⁴ collegia.' 'she Senate, Rc. 64,
had abolished many ‘collegia,' which were
⁵ urbana' and chiefly ‘ compitalicia,’ 01· such
as the inhabitants of the same ‘ compitum ’
formed. The purpose or the pretext for
establishing these ‘ collegia’ was the per-
formance of some religious ceremony, but
as these ⁴ collegia' were the cause of
‹lis-order, the Scnate abolished them (Asco-
nius in cornelianam, p. 75, ed. Orelli).
Clodius re-established the ‘ collegia ' which
the Senate had abolished: this was done by

vol.. 111.

his Lex ⁴ de collegiis restituendis novisque
instituendis.' These ‘ collegia compitalicia '
were among those ‘sacra,' from which
slaves were not excluded (Halm, from
Mommsen).

vicalim] According to the ‘vici’ of
each ⁴ compitum‚’ they were enrolled (con-
scribebantur), and formed into companies of
tens (decuriabantur). De Domo, c. 21.

arma in templum] De Domo, c. 21.
As to the taking away of the steps (Quum
Senatui, 6. 13, 11016; and In Pison. cc. 5,

iaihz'l reliqui mayistratus:] A double
genitive, one depending on the other,
¹⁶ nothing left of ‘ magistratus.' ’¹

duces nullos] The consuls. See cc. 8,
193 and De Domo, 38, note on ‘vobis
principibus.’

equester ordo . . . citaretur-d Said ‘ ora-
torie,’ as Manutius properly observes. Com-
pare 6. 12 : “ equites Romanos daturos illius
dici poenas.’'—‘alii metut’ the things
which he mentions in c. 17, the declara-
tions of Clodius that 116 was acting under
the advice of Pompeius, Crassus, and Cae-
sar, whose meaning was infcrred from their

silence, for they {lid 1101 contradict what
Clodius said (Manutius).
