434 ORAT. DE HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS

urbibus inferre potuerunt, excisionem, inflammationem, eversionem,
depopulationem, vastitatem, ea sua cum praeda meis omnibus tectis
atque agris intulerunt. Cum his furiis et facibus, cum his, in-
quam, exitiosis prodigiis ac paene hujus imperii pestibus bellum
mihi inexpiabile dico esse susceptum; neque id tamen ipsum tan-
tum, quantum meus ac meorum, sed tanturn quantum vester atque
omnium bonorum dolor postulavit. III. In Clodium vero non est
hodie meum majus odium quam illo die fuit, quum illum ambustum
religiosissimis ignibus cognovi muliebri ornatu ex incesto stupro
atque ex domo pontificis maximi emissum, Turn, inquam, tum
vidi ac multo ante prospexi quanta tempestas excitaretur, quanta
impenderet procella rei publicae. Videbam illud scelus tam impor-
tunum, audaciam tam immanem adolescentis furentis, nobilis, vul-
nerati non posse arceri otii finibus; erupturum illud malum ali-
quando, si impunitum fuisset, ad perniciem civitatis. Non multum
mihi sane post ad odium accessit. Nihil enim contra me fecit odio
mei, sed odio severitatis, odio dignitatis, odio rei publicae: non
me magis violavit quam senatum, quam equites Romanos, quam
omnes bonos, quam Italiam cunctam: non denique in me scele-
ratior fuit quam in ipsos deos immortales. Etenim illos eo scelere
violavit quo nemo antea: in me fuit eodem animo quo etiam ejus
familiaris Catilina si vicisset fuisset. Itaque eum numquam a me

hatred to Clodius (non multum). But
there was some ; and so he contradicts what
he has just said. Then he says, Clodius

but as the allusion is to the sacrifice of the
Bona Dea and to Clodius’ unholy intrusion⁷
every man may put his own meaning on
this expression. Again we can give a inean-
ing to ⁴ arceri otii finibus ’ by taking
⁴ arceri ’ to mean ‘coerceri ' or ⁴ contineri.'

odio (liquitalis,] om. P. Baiter puts it
in [ ]. “ Quicquid fecit Clodius, non fecit
odio ciceronis, sed odio severitatis et digni-
tatis Ciceronianae. Ridete, Patres Con-
scripti, quicquid est vobis cachinnorum '¹
(Wolf).

si vicisset fuisset] It is impossible to
follow this man’s thoughts, for they are all
in confusion. He says at the beginning of
the chapter that he does not hate Clodius
now more than he hated him on the day
when he profaned the inysteries of the Bona
Dea. This is a veryv liberal concession after
what Cicero had suffered from Clodius—He
saw at the time when Clodius profaned the
mysteries, that this villain would ruin the
state, if he were not punished. There was
in truth after this no great increase in his

did nothing against Cicero through hatred
ot him, but because he hated his ‘ dignitas ’
and the ‘ res publica.' Finally, Clodius did
not act more wickedly against Cicero than
against the immortal gods. But he treated
the immol-tal gods, as never man had treated
them before: his crime against the irn-
morta! gods was without a precedent. The
suppressed affirmation must be that he
was very wicked against Cicer03 and ‘his
disposition towards him was that which
Catiliua's would have been, if Catilina had
been victorious.y We may guess what thav
would have been3 something more than
hatred ; and yet Clodius did nothing against
Cicero through hatred. It would have been
more to the purpose if he had said that
Clodius’ disposition was that which Cati-
lina's had been; but perhaps this acute
Declamator saw that this would have spoiled

which applies to a different person, but
may have furnished the form of expression :
