honoris amplissimi nomen plus invidiae quam dignitatis afferre.—
Adfuerunt, inquit, Catilinae illumque laudarunt.—Nulla turn pate-
bat, nulla erat cognita conjuratio: defendebant amicum, aderant
supplici, vitae ejus turpitudinem in summis ejus periculis non inse-
quebantur. Quin etiam parens tuus, Torquate, consul reo de
pecuniis repetundis Catilinae fuit advocatus, improbo homini, at
supplici, fortasse audaci, at aliquando amico. Oui quum adfuit post
delatam ad eum primam illam conjurationem, indicavit se audisse
aliquid, non credidisse—At idem non adfuit alio in judicio, quum
adessent ceteri.—Si postea cognorat ipse aliquid, quod in consulatu
ignorasset, ignoscendum est iis qui postea nihil audierunt. Sin illa
res prima valuit, num inveterata quam recens debuit esse gravior?
Sed si tuus parens, etiam in ipsa suspicione periculi sui, tamen
humanitate adductus advocationem hominis improbissimi sella curuli
atque ornamentis et- suis et consulatus honestavit, quid est quam-
obrem consulares qui Catilinae adfuerunt reprehendantur 3—A1:
iidem iis, qui ante hunc caussam de conjuratione dixerunt, non ad-
fuerunt.—Tanto scelere astrictis hominibus statuerunt nihil a se
adjumenti, nihil opis, nihil auxilii ferri oportere. Atque ut de eorum
constantia atque animo in rem publicam dicam, quorum tacita
gravitas et fides de uno quoque loquitur neque cujusquam ornamenta
orationis desiderat, potest quisquam dicere umquam meliores, for-
tiores, constantiores consulares fuisse quam iis temporibus et peri-

mentioned afterwards3 on which trial the
consul Torquatus helped him, though Ca-
tilina is charged with having designed to
murder Torquatus Here Cicero tells us
that Torquatus said he had heard some-
thing of the conspiracy, but did not believe
it. We do not know what to believe our-
selves. It is very hard to believe Cicero.

post delatam αιί eum] Halm has a note
on ‘ eu1n,' which he says is logically right,
but contrary to the general use of the lan-
guage, which requires *ad se.’ I suppose
then that the general use of the language is
illogical. He adds, “the participial clause
thus appears as an independent clause, not
as an interxnediate clause swallowed up in
the chief clause. Examples are very rare.’'
But there are examples of such a use of ⁴ is,'
where some people expect the reflective
pronoun.

At idem] Torquatus -says this. He is
speaking of Catilina‘s trial in B c. 64 (In—
trod. to the orations against Catilina, p. 4).
Cicero say-5, if Torquatus had afterwards
found out something, which he knew not in

his consulship, he must excuse those who
afterwards heard nothing at all. But if the
first thing (delata ad eum conjuratio) was
the cause of his not assisting Catilina on
this last trial, “ ought the matter, when it
had become stale⁷ to have been considered
weighticr than when it was recent ?”

Sed si] With these words Cicero returns
to Torquatns' aid to Catilina on his trial,
when induced by his mild disposition (hu-
manitate) Torquatus honoured Catilina¹s
advocates (advocatio) by appearing seated in
his chair of office. The true reason why he
was there, says Halm, was more truly the
fear of this dangerous personal enemy. So
we may guess‚ or some other good reason;
not that which Cicero gives.

‘Advocatio' is the body of ‘advocatL'
Pro Roscio Com. c. 5, Vol. ΙΙ.

At iidem iis.] Another objection of the
prosecutor: the same men did not help on
their trial those who had been tried for the
conspiracy before Sulla was tried. This is
said to show their inconsistency, but Cicero
makes it a proof of their consistency.
