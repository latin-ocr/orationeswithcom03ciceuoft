198 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

Nullum in hac caussa testem timemus; nihil quemquam scire, nihil
vidisse, nihil audisse arbitramur. Sed tamen, si nihil vos P. Sullae
fortuna movet, judiceS, vestra moveat. Vestra enim, qui cum
summa elegantia atque integritate vixistis, 1100 maxime interest,
non ex libidine aut simultate aut levitate testium caussas honesto-
rum hominum ponderari, sed in magnis disquisitionibus repentinis-
que periculis vitam unius cujusque esse testem. Quam vos, ι10011005,
nolite armis suis spoliatam atque nudatam objicere invidiae, dedere
suspicioni. M unite communem arcem bonorum, obstruite perfugia
improborum. Valeat ad poenam et ad salutem plurimum, quam
solam videtis ipsam ex vi sua naturaque facillime perspici, subito
flecti fingique non posse.

XXIX. Quid vero haec auctoritas, semper enim de ea dicendum
est, quamquam a me timide modiceque dicetur, quid, inquam, hacc
auctoritas nostra, qui a ceteris conjurationis caussis abstinuimus,
P. Sullam defendimus, nihil hunc tandem juvabit? Grave est 1100

arcem bonorum] This is 1110 past life of
a man, his character, wbieh is the strong-
hold of the honest. He then says “stop
up the lurking places of the dishonest.’'

explains thus: ⁴⁶ id est quasi murum struite
adversus perfugium improborum.'' See
Vol. II. Verr. ii. 4. c. 36. There is no
various reading here.

The nominative to ‘valeat ad poenam ' is
‘vita.' Halm following T. has ‘ex sua
natura facillime.' This word ‘valeat' is
difficult to translate (Vol. Ι. Divin. c 193
In Cat. iii. 12). “Let that avail most
both for a man's acquittal and for his con-
demnation, his past life, which alone, as
you knOW, can be most easily judged by its
own character, and cannot all at once be
changed and assume a new character.”
Comp. c. 25: “Neque enim potest quis-
quam,’' &c.

2³1. auctoritas,] Halm as usual writes it
thus: ‘ Quid vero ? haec auctoritas) It is
the testimony of the speaker, not proper
testimony, for that 0011105 from a witness
on oath, but the declaration of a man whose

probability. In his larger edition he simply
mentions it. Ι can imagine no reason at all
for the conjecture. Cicer0, Ι suppose, might
have wri·ten either. The evidence is that
he wrote ‘ 501111101·.’--ι gravez’ ‘disagree-
able,' ‘offensive to people's ears.’ It is
ofl'ensive when we claim a thing (si appe-
timus aliquid), as for instance, credit for
what we say. A man should be silent about
himself. lf people will not talk about him,
and a man will talk about himself, people
will not like it. ‘⁴ But if we 310 attat-ked,
charged, made an object of dislike, then
indeed you must allow us, Judives, to retain
the liberty of speech, if we cannot main-
tain the dignity of our character.''
Accusati—consulares,] Torquatus blames
all, and Cicero among them, for helping
Sulla. The objection of Torquatus, con-
tained in the words ‘Adsuei-unt, inquit,
Catilinae‚’ must refer, as Halm sayS‚ to
Catilina's prosecution for ‘incestus ' (Introd.
to 1110 orations against Catilina), on which
occasion (Orosius, vi 3) Catilina owed his
acquittal to the support of Lutatius Catulus.
Catilina's prosecution ‘de repetundis’ is
