474 IN PRODUOTION.

all Cicero’s orations3 and much more copious, Ι think, than is necessary
for any purpose. Instead of collecting 111 1113 own notes all that is
good in the notes of other commentators, Halm has printed them
frequently entire; sometimes he has given the substance of them.
It is very useful however to have an edition of a separate oration with
a selection from the best notes of the commentator& ,Halm has fol-
lowed this plan, as it appears, because he does not wish to have the
credit of what others have done before him: he is particularly careful
to assign to every commentator his due, and he has evidently a high
sense of literary honesty, a thing which 13 by no means common either
in England or Germany, or in any country where book-making is the
fashion. His reproof of Klotz (0. 21, 11010) 13 1111 instance of his scru-
pulous exactness.

I have read all the notes in Halm's edition (Ι), and Ι have used
some of the commentators to whom he refers. I have not acknowledged
every reference which I have found ready to my hand, nor every re-
mark that I have used; but I have often mentioned the name of a
critic when I am more particularly indebted to him3 and Ι also make
this general acknowledgment here. If it will please any man to think
so, he may suppose that there is nothing of my own in the notes to this
oration3 but it is not true.

If any 0110 who has had patience to get through the four spurious
orations will read this speech Pro Sestio, he may perhaps see that the
Declamator has worked upon materials from Cicero, and he will see
the great difference between a good original and a bad copy.
