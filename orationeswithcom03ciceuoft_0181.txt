socio quum scirem defendere. Atque idem ego neque P. Sullam
supplicem ferre, neque eosdem Marcellos, pro hujus periculis lacri-
mantes aspicere, neque hujus M. Messallae hominis necessarii
preces sustinere potui. Neque enim est caussa adversata naturae,
nec homo, [nec res] misericordiae meae repugnavit. Nusquam
nomen, nusquam vestigium fuerat: nullum crimen, nullum indicium,
nulla suspicio, Suscepi caussam, Torquate, suscepi, et feci libenter
ut me, quem honi constantem, ut spero, semper existimassent,
eundem ne improbi quidem crudelem dicerent.

VII. Hic ait se ille, judices, regnum meum ferre non posse.
Quod tandem, Torquate, regnum? consulatus, credo, mei, in quo
ego imperavi nihil, et contralpatribus conscriptis et bonis omnibus
parui; quo in magistratu non institutum est a me, judices, regnum
sed repressum. An tum in tanto imperio, tanta potestate, non
dieis me fuisse regem, nunc privatum regnare dicis? quo tandem
nomine? Quod in quos testimonia dixisti, inquit, damnati sunt;
quem defendis, sperat se absolutum iri. Hic tibi ego de testimo-
niis meis hoc respondeo: si falsum dixerim, te in eosdem dixisse3
sin verum, non esse hoc regnare, quum verum juratus dicas, probare.
De hujus spe tantum dico, nullas a me opes P. Sullam, nullam
potentiam, nihil denique praeter fidem defensionis exspectare.
Nisi tu, inquit, caussam recepisses, numquam mihi restitisset, sed
indicta caussa profugisset. Si jam hoc tibi concedam, Q. Horten-
sium, tanta gravitate hominem, si hos tales viros non suo stare

Messallae] M. Valerius Messalla Niger
was consul in the next year Β c. 61. He is
supposed to be the man who took pains to
collect evidence for the defence of Sext.
Roscius Amerinus, whom Cicero defended
in ΒΛ). 80 (Pro Sext. Roscio Am. c. 51).
Cicero in a letter to Atticus speaks of Mes-
salla (i. 14, ξ 6) as an excellent consul, the
reason for which praise appears from the
letter.

[nec res] ] Halm omits these words in his
small edition. They are in V„ and Halm
retains them in his edition of Orelli's Cicero.
By the first part ofthe sentence Cicero means
that the case of Sulla was not opposed to
his natural disposition : it was a good case,
and he could undertake it without doing
any violence to his nature.

7. An lum] The reading of T. V. S.
Halm in his smaller edition has ‘An tu‚’
which clearly spoils the passage. In his
last edition he has ⁴ An tum.'—‘ in eosdem
dixisse? the common reading is ‘in eos,y
which has nothing to refer to. The Scholiast

seems to have read ‘ eosdem,’ which we ean
understand: ‘⁶ Aut invidiae meae particepsr
inquit, videberis, si quid in eo regaliter feci,
quod in sceleratos homines testimonium
disi, quoniam et te in eosdem dixisse mani-
festum est.'’—‘juratus :’ the old reading
was ‘juratos,' which Lambinus altered to
‘juratisff though he might have seen that
‘juratos ’ was only another form of ‘jura-
tus‚’ which reading is in A. T. V. Graevius
could not understand ⁶ probare,’ and he
thought that some ¹ sciolus ' put it in. He
thinks that the sense is complete without
⁶ probarc,’ but it is not. Cicero says:
‘⁸ but if Itold the truth, it is no assump-
tion of regal power, when you tell the truth
on oath, to make others believe that you
are tclling the truth.” ⁴ l'robare’ means
to make peoplc accept and believe (Verr. ii.
2. e. 43).
