de la Malle (Economie Politique des Ro-
mains, ii. 307) makes no difficulty about
this passage of Livy (Ep. 60), where he is
speaking of Gracchus' Law “ for distribut-
ing wheat to the poor citizens almost gra-
tuitously, that is, at the rate of gos an as
the modius.” In another passage (i. p.
107), where he is speaking of the price of
wheat at Rome, which he fixes according to
certain data at somewhat- less than 2 asses
the modius, he adds with reference to this

’ low price: “this is evidently again either

the price of wheat in an abundant year or a
price fixed for a gratuitous distribution like
that of the Ξ 35 the modius established by
the Sempronian Lex.'' But if we assume
that Livy’s Epitome is wrong, and that the
price at which Gracchus sold corn to the
poor was δὲ 35565, we have something
intelligible. For if the price was about
12 asses the modius in Cicero's time, as
both Boeckh and Dureau de 13 Μ3116 316
agreed, we learn that the poor got the grain
for about half price in Gracchus' time, if
the price of wheat was then 12 asses the
modius, and we also learn how much the
state was going to lose under Clodius’ Lex
by giving instead of selling at half price.

uni helluoni] Itis Gabinius. The end
of the chapter is defective. It stands thus
in P. : “deliberandi et rogata . . . amlegem
fieret provintiae commutandae‚'' with a
vacant space after ‘rogata’ of about nine-
teen letters. The blank is thus filled up
in Halm (2): “deliberandi et rogata leye
utrique potestas contra Semproniam le-
yem.''

26. eam leyem,] The Lex which re-
pealcd the Lex Aelia et Fufia (c. 15). ‘ J ura

religionum ' are the rules of law about ‘ re-
ligiones‚' ⁴ auspicia‚’ and magisterial autho-
rity. Halm correctly remarks that ‘potes-
tatum ’ does not mean the magistrates here,
as Bake supposes, but the magisterial
powers (die Rechte der veschiedenen Amts-
gewalten).

Here we have the expression ‘de jure
legum . . . rogandarum,' ‘about the legal
forms of proposing Leges,' an expression in
which there is no difficulty. See De Domo,
c. 15, 011 the form ⁴ de jure legum.'

domesticam labem:] All the mischief
done at 1101116, to which he opposes the
mischief done abroad3 and therefore ‘do-
mesticam labem’ does not mean Clodius'
private life, as Matthiae supposed. Manu-
tius explained it correctly.

Leye tribunicia] That is, a ‘plebis-
citum.' He says this contemptuously, since
he is speaking of matters that pertain to
religion (Hotmann). Halm refers to the
De Lege Agrar. 11. 8: “Leges enim sunt
. . . tribuniciae.’'

Pessimus] See De Harusp. c. 263 and
as to Brogitarus, De Harusp. c. 13. Pes-
sinus was a great emporium, as Strabo
says. The priests were of old a kind of
princeS‚ who enjoyed a great revenuc from
the priestly office. So things are still.

α popula] Manutius remarks that kings
received the title of ‘rex‚’ not from the
Populus, but from the Senate. These kings
had not even asked the Senate to give them
the title. Caesar (B. G. i. 35) says to the
German Ariovistus, ‘⁴ quum in consulatu
suo rex atque amicus 3 senatu appellatus
esset.’' See De Harusp. c. 13.
