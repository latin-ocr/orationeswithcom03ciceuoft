ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 3

him to be a villain, a murderer, a plunderer of his province3 but he
thought that it might help him in his own election if he could oblige
this bold patrie-ian. “If Catilina shall be acquitted,’' says Cicero to
Atticus, “I hope that he will be closely united with me in prosecuting
my canvass for the consulship3 but if it shall turn out otherwise, I shall
bear it as one of the things that happen in human life.''

During the year B.c. 64 Catilina was still forming his revolutionary
designs, and the circumstances of the time seemed to be favourable for
him. There was no army in Italy, and Rome's great general, Cn. Pom-
peius, was engaged in the east in the war against Mithridates. Catilina
found his adherents among the licentious youth of Rome, among Sulla's
old soldiers, who were spread over most parts of Italy, and among the
impoverished‚ luxurious Patricians who could only get rid of their debts
by getting rid of their creditors. There was now a great inequality in
fortunes. There was an enormous number of men in Rome who had
nothing. Wealth was in few hands, and men of mean birth, low seHows,
had got it. XVhatever danger there is from a rich aristocracy, there is
more from an army of noble beggars who hold the politica] power.
The facts which we learn from the historians and the orator, and the
state of Italy after the times of hIarius and Sulla, show clearly that the
conspiracy was a revolution of desperate insolvents.

About the first of June (13.0. 64) Catilina invited to a meeting the
men whom he had sounded severally. He laid before them his designs,
the means of execution, and 110 showed them the reward of their daring.
They were all poor3 all were in debt. Their present condition was
bad; the prospect was still worse. It was a miserable existence for
men who knew what pleasure was and had enjoyed luxury. There was
no way out of the difficulty except by a successful revolution, which
would give them wealth, and honours, and power. The insolvent revolu-
tionist has nothing to 105ος and he may gain (Sallust, Cat. c. 17, ἄτα).
Catilina still hoped to be elected consul, and to use the authority of his
office as a means for accomplishing his ends. He promised his men an
easy settlement of debts (tabulae novae), the proscriptiou of the rich,
and offices (magistratus), priestly honours, plunder, and every thing
else that is the consequence of war, and depends on the pleasure of
those who get a victory (Sallust, c. 21). It was to be the bloody time
of Sulla over again, without any of Sulla's more enlarged views. A
revolution by insolvent nobles, needy adventurers, and men of pleasure‚
has only one end and purpose; to cheat creditors, to fill the conspira-
tors' pockets at the expense of others, and to use the power of the
State for the benefit of the conspirators and those who will help to
support them.

In Β.0. 642 there were five candidates for the consulship of the year
