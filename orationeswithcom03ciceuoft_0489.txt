P. SESTIO

ORATIO

AD J UDICES.

I. Si quis antea, judices, mirabatur quid esset, quod pro tantis
opibus rei publicae tantaque dignitate imperii nequaquam satis
multi cives forti et magno animo invenirentur, qui auderent se et
salutem suam in discrimen offerre pro statu civitatis et pro com-
muni libertate, ex hoc tempore miretur potius, si quem bonum et
fortem civem viderit, quam si quem aut timidum aut sibi potius
quam rei publicae consulentem. Nam ut omittatis de unius cujus-
que casu cogitando recordari, uno adspectu intueri potestis eos,
qui cum senatu, cum bonis omnibus rem publicam afflictam exci-
tarint et latrocinio domestico liberarint, maestos, sordidatos, reos,
de capite, de fama, de civitate, de fortunis, de liberis dimicantes:

ex hoc tempore] Not only was P. Ses-

datus et reus,' and P. Lentulus was in dan-
ger (c. 69). ‘ Ex hoc tempore' means, as
Halm says, ‘ ab hoc inde tempore ;’ and we
cannot give it any other meaning. as some
critics have done. Halm (2) has ¹ is ex hoc
tempore,’ Mommsen's correction, founded
partly, I suppose, on the reading ‘ liber-
tates‚' Pl.

latrocinio domestico] He means all the
trouble caused by Clodius and his partizans.
Halm refers to c. 69, where Milo is called

comprehends his ‘civitas3’ and the conse-
quence of the ‘media capitis deminutio’
was the loss of ⁴ civitas.’ Accordingly when
Cicero adds ‘ de civit-ate‚’ he says nothing
new, but he says the same thing in another
form.

dimicantes :] Ernesti altered this to ‘ di-

‘ moliri,’ ‘timeress It is easier to see the
propriety of ‘dimicantes.' which has the
force of an adjective, than to give the rea-
son for the change from the participle to
the infinitive. Halm suggests that these
infinitives express acts which are partly to
be perceived by the eyes of the mind, while
