336 ORAT. QUUM POPULO GRATIAS EGIT

imperii vestri, in senatu mentio facta est. Tribuniciis superiores
illi rogationibus, nulla auctoritate senatus sunt restituti. Marius
vero non modo non a senatu, sed etiam oppresso senatu est resti-
tutus; nec rerum gestarum memoria in reditu O. Marii, sed
exercitus atque arma valuerunt. At de me ut valeret semper
senatus flagitavit: ut aliquando perficeretur, quum primum licuit,
frequentia atque auctoritate perfecit. Nullus in eorum reditu
motus municipiorum et coloniarum factus est3 at me in patriam
ter suis decretis Italia cuncta revocavit. Illi inimicis interfectis,
magna civium caede facta, reducti sunt: ego iis a quibus ejectus
sum provincias obtinentibus, inimico autem optimo viro et mitis-
simo, altero consule referente reductus sum 3 quum is inimicus, qui
ad meam perniciem vocem suam communibus hostibus praebuisset,
spiritu dumtaxat viveret, re quidem infra 01111165 mortuos amandatus
esset. V. Numquam de P. Popillio L. Opimius, fortissimus
consul, numquam de Q. Metello non modo C. Marius, qui erat
inimicus, sed ne is quidem qui secutus est M. Antonius, homo
eloquentissimus, cum A. Albino collega senatum aut populum est
cohortatus. At pro 1116 superiores consules semper ut referrent
flagitati sunt, sed veriti sunt ne gratiae caussa facere viderentur,

ut valeret] ‘de me ut valeret rerum
gestarum memoria ;’ ⁴ ut aliquando perfice-
retur’ the ¹ rerum gestarum memoriam
valere.’ Markland misunderstood this. Halm
has ‘aliquando proficeret.’—‘ter suis decre-
tisz' there were neither three ‘leges’ nor
three ‘ plebiscita,' for he means these, says
Wolf, for he says ‘ Italia cuncta.’ But the
word ⁴ decretis ’ is also the wrong word.

inimicis intersectis-d Marius did the work
himself. He made Rome flow with blood.
Popillius Laenas returned to Rome after
the death of C. Gracchus, B.c. 121 (Cicero,
Brutus, c. 25). Metellus Numidicus did
not return till nc. 9³), after the death of
Saturninus and his partizans.

allero consule] ‘ Altero consule, consule
referente ;' Mommsen, followed by Halm.
Some MSS. have ‘inimico hoc' without
‘ autem.⁷ The ‘is inimicus ⁷ is P. Clodius,
as some suppose3 Sex, Atilius, as Manutius
and others suppose. Some suppose it is
Aelius Staienus. Those who heard this
speech, if any body ever heard it, would
know no more than we do who is meant.
None of these men were dead. Indeed he
says of this ‘ inimicus’ that 116 lived ‘ spiritu,’
but in fact (re) ⁴ infra omnes mortuos aman-
datus esset.’ What could be more ridicu-
lous than this ? It means that he was really

dead (re), and only seemed 1ο be alive.
Markland compares a passage in the ora-
tion Pro P. Quintio, c. 15, where the ora-
tor qualifies the words: “non modo ex
numero vivorum exturbatur, sed, si fieri·
potest, etiam infra mortuos amandatur.''
But not ‘ infra omnes mortuos)

5. L. Opimius‚] He was consul B-C. 121
with Q. Fabius Maximus, and he was the
man who followed Gracchus to his death;
a cruel, bloodthirsty man, yet ‘fortissimus
consul.’ He afterwards took a bribe from
Jugurtha when he was sent into Africa to
divide the dominions of Micipsa between
Jugurtha and Adherbal. Cicero always
speaks well of this villain3 and the false
Cicero is true to his original here.

M. Antonius is the great orator, who was
consul B.c. 99.

yratiae caussa] He is speaking sarcas-
tically. He calls Piso an ‘affinis‚' because
he was a kinsman of Cicero⁷s son-in-law,
Piso. The other consul is Gabinius. After
he had been proconsul of Syria 116 was pro-
secuted 13.c. 5-1 011 3 charge of Repetundae,
and Cicero defended this dishonest tool of
Pompeius. The plain meaning of the text
is that Cicero had undertaken to defend
Gabinius in a ‘caussa capitalis,’ when he
made this supposed speech (11.0, 57). We
