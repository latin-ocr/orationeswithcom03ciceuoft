ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

illum summum ordinem omnium civium industriae ac virtuti pateret.
Senatum rei publicae custodem, praesidem, propugnatorem collo-
caverunt ; hujus ordinis auctoritate uti magistratus et quasi minis-
tros gravissimi consilii esse voluerunt: senatum autem ipsum proxi—
morum ordinum splendore confirmari, plebis libertatem et com-
moda tueri atque augere voluerunt.

tions must be going on continually, or guilty
men will be left unpunished. No person
wh0 had filled a high office at Rome was
safe against a prosecution, whether inno-
cent or guilty; but the innocent who were
prosecuted to conviction were very few3
the guilty who escaped were many. The
nobles attempted to protect one another,
and so long as the guilty senators were
tried by their own body, it was hard to
convict thern. C. Gracchus deprived the
senators of the privilege of being tried by
the Senate, and constituted the jury of
Equite53 but the Equites were often cor-
rupt too. Sulla, a staunch friend to his
order, set things right after his fashion.
He took away the office of jury from the
Equites in the trials for high misdemean-
ours and other criminal matters, and again
gave the Senate the power of acquitting
their friends. The Lex Aurelia (13.0. 70)
made a mixed jury of Senators, Equites,
and Tribuni Aera1·ii; but there was still
corruption. So difficult is it in any country
to bring great offenders to justice. The
Romans sometimes did punish a bad gene-
ral and a bad governor. We have no means
so efficient as they had of bringing such
men to trial. A man may spoil a campaign,
misgovern a province, cause mischief in..
finite by incapacity, carelessness, and neg-
lect of duty, and he will escape scot-free,
protected by the powerful order to which
he belongs, by the want of ready means of
bringing him to trial, and by the eost and
risk to the prosecutor who shall venture to
attack a great offender.

‘¹ To those who in a state are appointed
to be the guardians of its liberty no autho-
rity can be given more useful and necessary
than that of being able to accuse citizens
before the people or any magistrate or
council, when the citizens have offended
in any thing against the free state. This
ordination has two effects very useful for a
commonwealth. The first is this, that the
citizens through fear of being accused at-
tempt nothing against the state, and if they
do, they are immediately and without re-
spect checked. The other is, that a way is
thus given for the working off of those
humours which grow in states in any way

against any citizen. And when those hu-
mours have no ordinary means of working
themselves off, they have recourse to extra-
ordinary means, which cause the complete
ruin of a state. And there is nothing which
makes a state so stable and firm, as to order
it in such wise that the alteration of those
humours which agitate it shall have a way
of working themselves off, ordained by the
laws” (Discorsi‚ i. c. 7).

In this chapter Cicero is full of his lauda-
tion of the Senate. There is truth in what
he says; but he has only shown us one side
of the Senate, and the good side. What is
to become of a free state, as it is called, a
state in which there is a popular element,
where the guardians ot' liberty are become
one with a powerful oligarchy‚ and where
they sur-render one of their chief functions,
the punishment of great offenders, by join-
ing the party whom it is their duty to re-
sist ? When the representatives of the peo-
ple, people here being all except Senate,
or by whatever other name such a body is
called, have become one in interest and in
ways of thinking with those whom it is their
duty to resist and to check, the great secu-
rity for a state is gone3 administration at
home and abroad may be as corrupt as it
pleases, the just punishment of great of-
fenders is impossible by regular ways, and
a nation looks around to see what remedy
either chance or any thing else will offer to
them in the time of need.

splendore cowfirmari‚] Bake writes ‘splen-
dorem confirmare‚' which Halm accepts as
egregious‚ though the MSS. have ‘splen-
dore confirmari) The difference is not
great, but there should be a reason for the
change3 and here it is. For fear of not
rendering Bake’s meaning right, 1 give his
words ε “Quum dixerit, quem locum in rep.
teneret Senatus, magistratusque quasi mi-
nistros hujus gravissimi consilii, subjicit,
quid ipsum facere et praestare oporteat.
Sed hoc oblitteratum est in vulgata scrip-
tura. Statim offendit, quod una sententiae
comprehensione activum et passivum jun-
guntur. Sed quid illud tandem ipsum est,
senatum confirmari μναῖ. ord. splendore?
Non sane, proximis ordinibus aditum esse
in senatum, quum modo dixerit: aditum
