14 INTRODUCTION To THE

escaping into Gallia Cisalpina over the Apennines. But Q. Metellus
Celer, who was in Picenum with three legionS, posted himself at the
foot of the mountains exactly at the place where the rebels would have
come down. With the mountains in his rear, which he could not pass,
and the army of O. Antonius in front, there was no chance left but to
fight. Antonius was sick on the day of battle, and M. Petreius his
‘legatus’ commanded the army of the State. It was a furious contest,
hand to hand with the sword. Petreius at last broke the rebels’ centre,
and the battle was won. Catilina, seeing that all was lost, rushed into
the thickest of the fight and perished. The rebels died like men of
courage on the spot where they stood3 and even in the centre, where
they were broken, every man’s death-wound was in front. No quarter
was given3 no prisoners were made. Many who had come to see the
fight or to spoil the dead, turning over the lifeless bodies, found a friend
or a kinsman3 and some there were who recognized a dead enemy
(Sallust, Cat. c. 56—61).

This mad plot might have succeeded in spite of the risk that there is
of all conspiracies being detected when many men are engaged in them.
If there is a woman in the plot, it is sure to be spoiled; or a man who
is a woman in all but sex. In a state so corrupt as Rome was, the chance
of the conspiracy succeeding was very great, for it was known long
before active measures were taken to crush it. So true it is that a plot
against a republic is not so difficnlt a matter to accomplish as a plot
against a prince, as Machiavelli shows (Discorsi‚ iii. c. 6, Delle congiure).
The conspirators in Rome lost their lives because they committed them-
selves in writing‚ which a prudent conspirator will never do. If Catilina
had any design beyond the immediate satisfaction of his vengeance and
the plunder of the rich, it was to follow Sulla’s example, who had shown
that by shedding blood without pity and by the aid of the army a man
may usurp the chief power in a state. And this was his design, we
may assume3 for such a man must have looked beyond the first step.
He promised to do what usurpers now do in such a case. They take
from the ranks of the citizens ambitious and restless men, and make
them gentle, not in name, but in fact: they give them money, land, and
placcs3 they give thom means and men, men in arms. With all their
depcndants around them, who occupy every post, the usurpers maintain
their power, and their instruments have their ambition and their greedi-
ncss satisfi0d3 while all the rest are constrained to support that yoke
which force and nothing clsc makes thom endum (Machiavelli, Discorsi
i. c. 55).

A sketch of Catilina's conspiracy is prefixed by Halm to his edition
os these four orations3 and Drumann (Geschichte Bonis, v. 377—577)
has written the history at some length. I have used both. Some critics
