CAP. 7, 8. 105

morandis jacebant. Quum ego vero tanto intervallo claustra ista
nobilitatis refregissem, ut aditus ad consulatum posthac, sicut apud
majores nostros fuit, non magis nobilitati quam virtuti pateret, non
arbitrabar, quum ex familia vetere et illustri consul designatus ab
equitis Romani filio consule defenderetur, de generis novitate accu-
satores esse dicturos. Etenim mihi ipsi accidit ut cum duobus
patriciis, altero improbissiino atque audacissimo, altero modestis-
simo atque optimo viro, peterem; superavi tamen dignitate Catili-
nam, gratia Galbam. Quod si id crimen homini novo esse deberet,
profecto mihi neque inimici neque invidi defuissent. Omittamus
igitur de genere dicere, cujus est magna in utroque dignitas: videa-
mus cetera.

Quaesturam una petiit, et sum ego factus prior. Non est re-
spondendum ad omnia3 neque enim quemquam vestrum sugit,
quum multi pares dignitate fiant, unus autem primum solus possit
obtinere, non eundem esse ordinem dignitatis et renuntiationis,
propterea quod renuntiatio gradus habeat, dignitas autem sit per-
saepe eadem omnium. Sed quaestura utriusque propemodum pari
momento sortis fuit. Habuit hie lege Titia provinciam tacitam et
quietam: tu illam, cui, quum quaestores sortiuntur, etiam acclamari
solet, Ostiensem, non tam gratiosam et illustrem, quam negotiosam
et molestam. Consedit utriusque nomen in quaestura. Nullum

ble their families‚ but even though they
cited the names of men of modern times,
the Marii, and the Didii, and the Caelii,
were still neglected.'' Didius was T. Didius,
consul Β 6. 98, a ⁸ novus horno ; 'and Caelius
is C. Caelius Caldus, consul Rc. 94 (De
Lege Agraria, ii. 1, note).

tanto intervallo] See Vol. ΙΙ. Β6 Lege
Agraria, ii. c. 1. This is the old story
about himself. His electiori again opened,
as he says, the consulship to the men of low
estate. The first plebeian consul was L.
Aemilius Mamercinus (Livy, vii. l).

Galbam] He attributes his success
against Catilina to his superior merit; and
against P. Sulpicius Galba to his popularity.
He speaks of Galba’s canvass for the consul-
ship in a letter to Atticus (i. l): “ Prensat
unus P. Galba.'

Quaesturam—prior.] Servius is sup-
posed to say this3 and Cicero on behalfof
Murena replies that when several are elected
to the same office, some one must be re-
turned (renuntiatus) first. There are de-
grees of first and second, and so on, in the
proclaiming of the names of the successful
candidates, but the honour or the merit of

the candidates who are elected is the same.
He says, Pro Plancio, c. 6 : ‘⁴ Sunt omnes
sine macula, sunt aeque boni viri atque in-
tegri, sed servari 11666556 est gradus.'’

leye Titia] It is sometimes stated that
this was a Lex enacted on the proposal of a
tribune Titius, by which the number of
quaestors was doubled and made eight, and
other arrangements about the quaestorship
were made. This may be true, but it is
only a conjecture of Pighius. Servius had
for his ‘provincia’ the town of Ostia, the
port of Rome at the mouth of the Tiber,
which was less valued than a provincial
quaestorship. The ‘acclamatio’ of the
people, when it was known that the lot had
determined who was to have the Ostiensis,
was a shout of derision, for this was a labo-
rious office, and nothing was to be maile by
it. There were ‘salinae ' at Ostia, and the
corn imported into Rome also came through
it. Compare Dion Cassius (55. c. 4), and
Pro Sestio, 6. 17: ‘⁴ Saturnino, qui quod a
se quaestore Ostiensi, per ignominiam ad
principem et senatus et civitatis M. Scau—
rum rem frumentariam translatam sciebat.''
