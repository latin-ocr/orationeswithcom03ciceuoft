92 INTRODUOTION TO THE

loss of his only daughter Tullia. When Servius died on a mission to
M. Antonius in the camp before Mutina (13.0. 43), Cicero pronounced
his panegyric in the Senate, and moved that he should have a public
funeral and a bronze statue, which was placed in front of the Rostra
(Philipp. ix).

Cicero had two formidable opponents to answer, the most virtuous
and enlightened of the Roman jul-ists, and a rigid Stoic, who practised
what he professed. There is no fear of a careful reader taking literally
all Cicero’s ridicule of the law. The best thing that he could do for his
client was to show that the profession of arms was nobler than the
profession of the law3 and he may be excused if he laid hold of the
forms of law, of the ridiculous side of it, of that which disgusts every
man of taste, in order to raise a laugh and put the J udices in humour.
The Romans had good sense, they were ready at apprehending legal
principles, and they could apply them well to facts3 but as procedure
must have its forms, which are sometimes kept after they have lost their
original meaning, as every thing turns on words and expression, by
which all the intercourse of life is regulated3 and as men of small
capacity and narrow views are most ready and most fit for conducting
most of the common business of life3 so it happens that the law becomes
a field of petty warfare in which little minds and mean men contend
about trifles at the cost of their clients. Cicero did right to ridicule
these miserable pettifoggers. The character of Servius was too well
known to suffer from Cicero’s ridicule, which perhaps did no more than
make him smile. He knew what he was, and Cicero did too, and all
Rome. What other opinion could this accomplished man have about
the trivialities of the law than Cicero himself? Perhaps no man is
more impatient of the fraud, meanness, and miserable trifling of the
ignorant lawyer, than the man who is a master of the science and would
maintain its honour. The ridicule of the Stoics could touch Cato as
little as the ridicule of the lawyers touched Servius. There were pre-
tenders to philosophy then as there are now3 men who delighted in
paradoxes, and who would rather be notorious even as fools than live
unknown iu obscuffity, conscious of the rectitude of their judgment and
of their integrity. The speech, if well delivered, as we assume that it
was, must have produced the effect that the consul wished, to exalt the
soldier in the eyes of the J udices, to show them that the sword was the
sign by which Rome held her power, and to amuse them with ridicule of
things well known to the ‚Iudices in their daily experience, and which
every man would take a pleasure in laughing at. To keep his J udices
in good humour, and to make them merry at the expense of the pro-
secutors, was Cicero’s purpose; and whether the facts of bribery were
strongly urged against Murena or not, the best thing he could do for
