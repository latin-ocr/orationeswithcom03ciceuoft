OAP. 33—35. 399

gerenda re [publica] putabatur fuisse segnior, gesta multis senatus-
consultis non modo defendit, sed etiam ornavit: mihi aut te inter-
fecto cum consulibus, aut te vivo et tecum et cum illis armis decer-
tandum fuit. Erant eo tempore multa etiam alia metuenda. Ad
servos, medius fidius, res pervenisset. Tantum homines impios ex
vetere illa conjuratione inustum nefariis mentibus bonorum odium
retinebat.

Hic tu me etiam gloriari vetas: negas esse ferenda quae soleam
de me praedicare, et homo facetus inducis etiam sermonem urbanum
ac venustum3 me dicere solere esse me J ovem, eundemque dictitare
Minervam esse sororem meam. Non tam insolens sum quod
Jovem esse me dico, quam ineruditus quod Minervam sororem
J ovis esse existimo. Sed tamen ego mihi sororem virginem ascisco ς
tu sororem tuam virginem esse non sisti. Sed vide ne tu te soleas
J ovem dicere, quod tu jure eandem sororem et uxorem appellare
possis. XXXV. Et quoniam hoc reprehendis, quod solere me
dicas de me ipso gloriosius praedicare, quis umquam audivit, quum
ego de me nisi coactus ac necessario dicerem? Nam si, quum
mihi furta, largitiones, libidines objiciuntur, ego respondere soleo,

 

retinebat] ‘ Odium 1611611313,γ Heri-agius,
and that is what he ought to have said; but
it seems that he did not say it. P. has
¹ odiumne tenebat.’ It is supposed that
‘ retinebat ’ is sometimes put sor ‘ tenebat.'
It may be sog ,but some of the examples
which are c'ited do not prove it3 and the
use of the two words is different. Wolf has
a remark on the ἀκατάλληλον of the ‘ struc-
tura ’ of this sentence: ‘ Sed publicam cau-
sam . . . decertandum fuit.’ When a man
knows all the facts, he sees what is meant.
But the sentence is very bad.

esse me J0vem‚] This is said in order to
introduce the beautiful antithesis of ‘mihi
sororem virginem,’ and ‘ tuam sor-orem vir-
ginem 3' and the smart repartee which fol-
lows. And we are to believe that this filthy
stuff was spoken before the Pontifices in
Clodius’ presence, when Cicero was arguing
for the area of his house.

He continues in the next chapter in the
same strain. ‘¹ who ever heard him boast,
except when he was compelled?⁷’ Who?
It is his practice, he says, to speak of his
services in saving his country when he is
charged with theft and the like3 but the
only charge brought against him before these
very hard times was his cruelty at that time
(illius temporis), the time of the conspiracy.
It is rather difficult to see what are the

very hard times, but we will suppose thern
to be the times of his exile3 for they cannot
be the times of his return. The charges
of theft and the like, then, were made in
and about the very hard times when he

*was driven into exile; and it was his prac-

tice then to speak of his services to the
state, which speaking must be considered
not so much a boasting of his services as a
refusal to admit the charge of theft and so
forth. There seems to be a time wanting
to which we can refer this practice (soleo) of
not pleading to a charge of theft by speak-
ing of something else. It is tedious to talk
about such tedious stuff. Any person of
common sense will see there is none here.
Yet all the critics do not3 and from this a
conclusion may be made. Cicero had a
statue of Minerva in his house, which he
took to the Capitol before he left Rome:
“He carried to the Capitol the statue of
Athene, which for a long time had stood in
his house, and to which he paid especial
honour, and dedicated it with the inscrip-
tion, ⁴ To Athene, the guardian of Rome ’ ''
(Plutarch‚· Cicero, c. 31). Cicero mentions
this statue in the Dc Legibus, ii. 17. This
may have furnished the Declamator with
some of this matter, which he has handled
with such ability.—‘ non confiteri ι’ ‘confi-
teri,’ Baiter. Some MSS. omit ‘ non.’
