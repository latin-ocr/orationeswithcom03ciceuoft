vetus quae quondam opibus, imperio, gloria floruit, hoc uno malo
concidit, libertate immoderata ac licentia contionum. Quum in
theatro imperiti homines, rerum omnium rudes ignarique, conse-
derant, tum bella inutilia suscipiebant, tum seditiosos homines rei
publicae praeficiebant, tum optime meritos cives e civitate ejicie-
bant. Quod si haec Athenis tum, quum illae non solum in Graecia,
sed prope cunctis gentibus enitebant, accidere sunt solita, quam
moderationem putatis in Phrygia aut in Mysia contionum fuisse?
Nostras contiones illarum nationum homines plerumque perturbant.
Quid, quum soli sunt ipsi, tandem fieri putatis? Caesus est virgis

ausus. Data contio Laelio est. Processit ille, et Graecus apud
Graecos non de culpa sua dixit, sed de poena questus est. Porrex-

Mithridates, qui multitudinem illam non auctoritate sua, sed sagina
tenebat, se velle dixit, id sutores, id zonarii conclamarunt. Hoc
testimonium est civitatis? Ego testes a Sicilia publice duxi.
Verum erant ea testimonia non concitatae contionis, sed jurati
senatus. Quare jam non est mihi contentio cum teste: vobis
videndum est sintne haec testimonia putanda.

porting corn in a famine· It is not said then all the cobblers,tailors, heltmakera all
who flogged him, nor by whose orders it the citizens by acclamation voted just what

was done. If a man exported corn in a
famine in some parts of Europe now, he
would be killed by the people, if they could
get at him. Athenagoras after being floggcd
was allowed to address the Ecclesia3 and
he complained of the flogging. The people
held out their hands : and that was a reso-
lution (ψὴφισμα). Τ1115 was the Greek way
of doing such things. ‘⁴ Is this,” says Cicero,
“evidence? Is a ‘psephisma’ made in
this way a thing that we can take as evi-
‹lence?'’

‘Data contio Laelio η’ some critics sup-
pose that it should be ‘a Laelio 3’ but the

betteri opinion is that ‘Laelio’ should be

with contempt of the handicraftsmen who
filled the Greek popular assemblies. (See

Klotz tells us how this reading got into
some of the MSS. It is only necessary to
suppose that the copier thought of his ass’

was then writing.
