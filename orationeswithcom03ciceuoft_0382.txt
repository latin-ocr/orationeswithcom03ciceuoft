ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

senatus aut populi aut eorum qui de quaque re constituti judices

sint detrahi possit.

Videsne me non radicitus evellere omnes

actiones tuas, neque illud agere, quod apertum est, te omnino nihil
gessisse jure, non fuisse tribunum plebis hoc dico, esse patricium?

Dico apud pontifices: augures
publico.

adsunt: versor in medio jure

Quod est, pontifices, jus adoptionis? nempe ut is adoptet qui

nis extra ordinem consulibus mandavit.'’
There is little or hardly any evidence that
the senate sat as a court for the trial of
crimes even in the earlier periods. The
Populus was the judge ‘ de capite civium ’
in the Centuriata Comitia. The appoint-
ment of special commissioners to try crimes
was a later practice, and the examples from
Livy explain Polybius. The Quaestiones
perpetuae, or regular courts for the trial of
crimes, were first established by the Lex
Calpurnia de rep. 13.c. 149. (Vol. I. RE-
PETUNDAE.) The remark in the text would
establish an historical error. if we under-
stood it according to the plain meaning of
the words3 but this is not an argument
against the genuineness of the oration, for
Cicero himself is often inaccurate in his
historical facts.

Klotz says that it was important for
Cicero to assert for the senate the power of
deciding ¹ de capite civis 3' and he had even
put to death the conspirators ‘ senatus
judicio.' “ It is true that the opposite
party would not admit the competence of
the senate in this matter, but Cicero was
obliged to mention it for his own sake and
also maintain that it was legal.” Ι allow
that Cicero might lie and did lie, When
nobody or a few only could contradict him ;
but I cannot be persuaded that he would
say what every man who heard him knew
to be false. And who ever heard of the
conspirators being condemned by a ‘judi-
cium ¹ of the senate? This statement is as
false as that in the text.

Videsne me . . . patricium .?] This pas-
sage stands thus in Baiter: “Videsne me
radicitus evellere . . . meque illud agere . . .
non fuisse tribunum pl., hodie esse patri-
cium ?” Lambinus erased the ‘non ' before
‘radicitus ς’ and for ‘neque illud’ wrote
⁴ me illud.’ As to ‘hodie' Baiter says “ lzo-
die P.. hoc G., hunc M„ om. V.y hoe
(lico Orelli.'’ There is a reading ‘parri-
cidium’ or ‘patricidiumss which Baiter does
not notice. On ‘ hoc dico, te esse patri-
cium‚' Lambinus says, ‘¹ Sic est legendum,
et ita igitur in libris manuscript. non, ut in
vulgatis ‘ hoc dico esse parricidium! ’⁹ Pal.

nonus (V.) has ‘esse patricium‚' omitting
‘ hoc dico ' (Gruter). Ι suppose that ‘hoc
dico’ is in some MSS. Baiter’s text gives
a reasonable meaning to the passage3 and
it agrees with the termination of c. 14.

auyures azimun] Nobody has yet dis-
covered how the Augurs got. here, unless we
can find out from c. 15. Were the Augurs
present to give judgment in a matter
which belonged to the cognizance of the
Pontifices, or were most of the Pontifices
also Augurs? ‘⁴ Prius falsum, posterius
parum verisimile esse, optime ostendit Fer-
ratius. Restat ergo, ut cum hoc viro docto
Augures fortuito, non necessario, praesentes
putemus, aut ad eam sententiam reverta-
mur, quae tot similibus difficultatibus me-
detur, ut ista verba-verba esse credamus '’
(Wolf).—‘ versor in medio jure publico:’
he has this expression (De Or. i. 39) where
he is speaking of the case of M. Curius:
“in medio jure civili versari.'’ Wolf finds
fault with the expression here; but I see
nothing in his remark. There is a more
weighty objection than this. He is speak-
ing before the Pontifices, in the presence of
the Augurs; and ‘he is in the very midst
of the Jus Publicum ;’ but it appears from
what he goes on to tell us, “ quaeri a pon-
tificum collegio solet,’' that he is in the
midst of the ‘Jus Pontificium ;’ and so he
says at the beginning of c. 14: ‘⁴ nego istam
adoptionem pontificio jure esse factam :''
and he repeats it at the end: “contra
omne pontificium jus factam.’' So we learn
that ⁴ Jus Publicum ⁹ was sometimes equi-
valent to ⁴ Jus Pontificium.' It is true that
⁴ Jus Pontificium ' would be comprehended
within the ⁴ Jus Publicum ’ by force of the
definition : “publicum jus est, quod statum
rei Romanae spectat,'’ but as a part of the
‘Jus Publicum.' Schrader iu his note on
this passage of the Institutes (i. l. ξ 4),
says that Cicero, Pro Domo, c. 13, refers
‘ consecratio ’ to the ‘Jus Publicum.' But
this Cicero, whom he cites, does more. He
confounds ‘Jus Publicum’ and ‘Jus Ponti-
ficium ⁷ or ‘ Pontificum.'
