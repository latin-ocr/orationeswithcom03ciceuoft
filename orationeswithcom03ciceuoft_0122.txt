oRAT. PRO L. MURENA

consultoribus respondeas: ille, ut eo quo intendit mature cum exer-

citu perveniat.

Tu actionem instituis, ille aciem instruit.
tores, ille ne urbes aut castra capiantur.

Te gallorum, illum buccinarum cantus exsuscitat.

Tu caves ne tui consul-
Ille tenet et scit ut

hostium copiae, tu ut aquae pluviae arceantur: ille exercitatus est

in propagandis finibus, tu in regendis.

X. Ac nimirum, dicendum

est enim quod sentio, rei militaris virtus praestat ceteris omnibus.
Haec nomen populo Romano, haec huic urbi aeternam gloriam
peperit, haec orbem terrarum parere huic imperio coegit: omnes

(In Flavium Vopiscum Notae, p. 423); and
it is certainly 1116 meaning in the following
passage of Catullus (47. v. 5),

‘⁴ Vos convivia lauta sumptuose
De die facitis‚’'

where ‘de die ' means ⁴ de meridie.' They
began to eat at midaeiay. In the expression
‘media de luce’ (Horace, Ep.i. 14. v.34)‚ and
011161· like passages, the meaning is fixed by
the adjective, and it is ⁴ from mid-day,' and
of course ⁴ after.’
qczllorzcm,]
‘¹ Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus
Sub galli cantum consultor ubi ostia pul-
sat.'’ (Horace, Sat. i. l. v. 8.)

Livy says (vii. 35) : “ Ubi secundae vigiliae
buccina datum signum esset, armati cum
silentio ad se venirent.’' See Vol. I. Verr.
ii. 4. c. 44. In Ovid (Met. i. 335) the
⁴ buccina ' is Triton’s shell.

actionem institzcz's‚] The ‘actio' is the
general term for legal procedure for the
recovery of a right or for damages for an
injury. The ‘actio' is the proceeding of
the actor or plaintiff. ‘ Instituere' means
to arrange the action, to prepare it3 to
ascertain what is the demand, and what is
the form in which it is to be made: to
select from all the Formulae that which fits
the case, for there were Formulae for all
cases (Pro Roscio Com. c. 8).

tenet] This means ‘mente tenet! “The
general understands and knows how to keep
off the enemy's force3 your knowledge and
skill are employed in keeping off rain water.'’
This is rather a frigid piece of humour, but
it is not so bad in Latin as in English.
⁴ Aqua pluvia’ is the rain which falls. The
rain which comes on a man’s land or house
must run off somewhere. if it does not sink
into the earth3 and the Romans had rules of
law to determine the rights and duties of
persons whose property was contiguous with
respect to the rain water. If one man had
a right to turn the dripping from his eaves

on his neighbour's premises, he had a ‘jus
stillicidii) There is a title in 1116 Digest
(39. 3) “De Aqua et aquae pluviae ar..
cendae.” Servius being a jurisconsult would
be acquainted with the law about. such mat-
ters. In a passage in the title just cited
(5. 1. ξ 6) 111 an excerpt from Ulpian it is
said: “ Sed apud Servii auditores relatum
est: si quis salicta posuerit et ob hoc aqua
restagnaret, aquae pluviae arcendae agi
posse, si ea aqua vicino noceret.’' The
‘ Servii auditores ’ is the name of a compila-
11011 made by Aufidius Namusa from some
of the pupils of Servius Sulpicius. The
opinion of Trebatius, also a pupil of Ser—
vius, is cited in the Digest (39. 3. 3. ξ l,
and ll. ξ (i).

propayandis—reyendis] See In Cat. ii.
5, note 011 ‘ propagarit.’ hlurena was em-
ployed in extending limits, Servius in regu-
lating boundaries. The expression would
be easily understood by a Roman. Cicero is
again playing on words. The Actio finium
regundorum (Dig. 10. tit. 1) is the legal
process for settling disputes about the
boundaries of contiguous estates. The Ro-
mans had many good rules about this.
Quintilian, Inst. (ix. 3), has quoted two pas-
sages from this chapter: ‘Vigilas tu——capi-
antur‚’ and ‘ Ille tenet et scit—tu in regen-
dis!

10. Haec nomen] Cicero is bantering
Servius in this chapter, and we must not
take it to contain his real opinions3 cer-
tainly not his real opinion about the study
of law. He says to Cato (De Fin. iv, 27):
“Omnia peccata paria dicitis. Non ego
tecum jam 113 loquor ut iisdem his de
rebus quum L. Murenam te accusante de-
fenderem. Apud imperitos tum illa dicta
sunt; aliquid etiam coronae datum: nunc
agendum est subtilius.'' But he said the
truth about the military art. R0me⁷s su-
premacy was won by the sword, and main-
tained by it. To the soldier in Rome the
first honour was due. For without the sol-
dier Rome was nothing.
