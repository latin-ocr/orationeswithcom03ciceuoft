XLVII. Majoribus praesidiis et copiis oppugnatur res publica
quam defenditur, propterea quod audaces homines et perditi nutu
impelluntur et ipsi etiam sponte sua contra rem publicam inci-

neglectis ad extremum ipsa denique necessitate excitantur, ita ut
nonnumquam cunctatione ac tarditate, dum otium volunt etiam sine
dignit-ate retinere, ipsi utrumque amittant. Propugnatores autem
rei publicae qui esse voluerunt, si leviores sunt, desciscunt; si timi-
diores, desunt: permanent illi soli atque omnia rei publicae caussa
perferunt, qui sunt tales, qualis pater tuus, M. Scauro, fuit, qui a

Halm has
copied out some of the trite commonplaces
of the commentators on this chapter. This
is one on ‘principiis rerum 3’ ‘contra re-
gulam illam‚ principiis obsta‚’ from Gesner,
the Declamator's friend, I suppose.
Cicero's remark was perhaps true of
Rome; it is perhaps true of all democracies,
though Rome was not a democracy. But
it is not true of modern states which are
not democracies. ln these states the de-
fence is more vigorous than the attack : the
vigilance of those who are threatened equals
the activity of the assailant, and in unity
and resources those who hold power are
stronger than those who would overthrow

it. A democracy is more easily assailed
than a despotism or a mixed government3
for in a democracy those to whom power
is delegated may use it against those who
trust them with it. But there is one security
for all governments or any government in
these times. We live in the age of gold,
not the golden age; and whatever may be
the revolutions of modern society, there is
one thing which will always be safe. The
‘ aerarium,' the treasury‚ the public funds,
the associations for enterprises of industry,
and the enormous wealtb which so many
now possess and all covet, is the Palladium
of modern states. This Palladium is not
the image of liberty, nor an image which
has come down from heaven : it is an image
of gold, which is worshipped with all since-
rity and saith 3 and for which we are ready
to sacrifice our liberty, our honour, and our
lives.

pater tuzc.v,] The father was M. Aemi-

lius Scaurus, consul B.c. 115. The son
Scaurus whom Cicero addresses was the
praetor who sat as judge in this trial.

a C. Graccho usque ad Q. Varium]
From Rc. 123 to B.c. 90. Aurelius Victor,
De Vir. Illust. iii. c. 72 : “ tantumque auc-
toritate potuit (Scaurus) ut Opimium contra
Gracchum, Marium contra Glauciam et
Saturninum armaret.'' From this passage
only Freinsheim (Supp. Liv. 61. c. 20) and
after him Heinrichsen (Cic. De Or. ii. c.
25) seem to have conjectured that the
SCtum which authorized Opimius to see ‘ Ne
quid Res Publica detrimenti caperet' was
passed on the motion of Scaurus (Halm).

Q. Varium] Halm quotes a note from
Asconius in Scaurianam, p. 22: “The
Italic war having broken out, and owing to
the ‘ civitas’ having been refused to the Ita-
lians, the nobles being very unpopular,
Q. Varius trib. pl. carried a Lex to the
effect that there should be an investigation
into the case of those by whose aid or advice
the Italians had taken up arms. Then Q.
Caepio, an old enemy of Scaurus, thinking
he had got an opportunity of crushing him,
induced Q. Varius to summon Scaurus be-
fore him on the charge of stirring up the
war. Scaurus was seventy-two years old,
and i11; but he came to the Forum, and
spoke thus: Ἐξ. Varius Hispanus says
that M. Scaurus princeps senatus has called
the Socii to arms. M. Scaurus princeps
senatus denies it3 there is no witness3
which of the two, Quirites, should you be-
lieve?’ These words so changed men’s
minds, that even the tribune let him go.’'
