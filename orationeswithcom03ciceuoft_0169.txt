ORATION FOR P. SULLA. 155

Rome at this time, but this conclusion is certainly not justified by the
passage of Dion. The conservative party, as some writers call it, opposed
the Lex3 or as Dion says, Cicero and those who were of the same
opinions, and the Lex was withdrawn, Sulla himself declaring that he did
not wish it to pass (c. 22, 223). From another passage in this oration
(c. 18) we conclude that Sulla was in Rome in B.c. 63, during Cicero's
consulship, for Torquatus charges him with being privy to the design of
murdering Cicero on the 2Sth of October (Introd. to the Orations
against Catilina, p. 6). He still, as it seems, made N aples his residence,
aud the accuser charges him with collecting a body of gladiators in
Campania, under the pretext that they were to be exhibited at the
games which Faustus Sulla was going to celebrate after Roman fashion
in mcmory of his father the Dictator (c. 19). He also charged Sulla
with encouraging dissension between the inhabitants of Pompeii and
the colonists settled there with the view of raising a disturbance and
getting possession of the town with the aid of the old inhabitants (c. 21).
And further, his intimacy with P. Sittius was made a ground of suspicion
against him (c. 20). It is said that Sittius was sent on some missiou
into Spain by Catilina, who reckoned upon him as a safe adherent
(Sallust, Cat. c. 21). There is no evidence except what has been here
stated, that P. Sulla was implicated in Catilina's second conspiracy.

Q. Hortensius and Cicero defended Sulla against Torquatus the son,
who had prosecuted Sulla and Autronius on the charge De Ambit-u.
Hortensius undertook to defend Sulla against the charge of being privy
to the first conspiracy, and Cicero, who knew the history of the second
conspiracy, undertook to defend him on that charge. Some modern
writers have attempted to discover the reason why Cicero undertook
Sulla's defence. His own statement is that he was asked to do it, and
saw no reason why he should not, for he believed him to be innocent.
Gellius (xii. 12) has preserved a story which, if it is true, helps to
explain the matter. Sulla was rich, and Cicero wished to buy a house
on the Palatine. As usual he had no ready money, and Sulla lent it to
him at the very time when he was under an accusation (quitum reus
erat). Gellius quotes the story as an instance of Cicero's facetiae, but
it is a proof of his dishonesty. He borrowed two millions of sestertii
from Sulla, but before the purchase was completed, the fact of the loan
was known. Cicero however denied that he had borrowed the money:
he said that he did not intend to buy the house, and he was willing that it
should be taken as a proof of thc loan if ever he bought it. He afterwards
did buy the house, and when he was charged in the Senate with lying,
hc laughed outright, and said, â€œ You arc stupid follows, not to know that
it shows a man to be a prudent and careful managcr, when hc intends
to buy a thing and says that he will not buy, in order to escape corn-
