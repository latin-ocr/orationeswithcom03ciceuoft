292 INTRODUOTION.

elected ‘ tribunus plebis,’ he, who was a patrician, prevailed on P. Fon-
teins, a plebeian, a youth of twenty years of age or thereabouts‚ to
adopt him as his son. The consequence of such an adoption, if it were
done in due form, would be to make Clodius legally the son of Fonteius,
to deprive him of his rank, to reduce him to the condition of a plebeiam
but at the same time to make him eligible to be a ‘tribunus plebis.'
Cicero says that the adoption (adrogatio) could not be made because of
the ages of the two persons, and that it was not effected in proper form.
Caesar, who was Pontifex Maximus, had taken part in the ceremony of
the adrogation, and Pompeius had assisted as ν Augur3 Rome’s two
greatest commanders, both of them priests, taking part in a fraud under
the name of religion. In December nc. 59 Clodius entered on his
duties as tribune, and brought forward several measures with the view
of getting the favour of the Optimates as well as os the people. In the
next year he made an indirect attack on Cicero by proposing a Rogatio
to this effect, That whoever had put to death a Roman citizen without a
trial and judgment should be laid under the interdict of fire and water.
The Rogatio contained no person's name3 and if it applied to any per-
sons, it applied to all the members of the Senate who had voted for the
execution of Lentulus and the other conspirators; M. Cato among the
rest. It was however known that Cicero was the object of the Rogatio,
and he admitted that he was by acting as if he had received notice of a
formal prosecution. After Roman fashion he put on the dress of mourn-
ing or humiliation, and endeavoured to excite popular commiseration,
for-getting that he who condemns himself, he who despairs of his own
case, is not likely to get any help from others. Cicero knew this and
had said it (Pro Murena, c. 21), but he did not practise what he taught.
He had a large number in his favour3 the best part of the Senate put
on the mourning or humiliation dress to show their sympathy with
their leader3 and the Equites, whom he had always tried to conciliate,
and many of the patrician youth, were on his side. The consuls L. Cal-
purnius Piso, Caesar’s father-in-law, and A Gabinius, a tool of Cn·
Pompeius, were against Cicero. Caesar would not help him 3 and even
Pompeius, whom he had flattered on all occasions, refused his protection.
Pompeius, it is said, went out of Rome to avoid seeing Cicero, a story
which has probability in its favour from the character of Pompeius, who
like many mean and irresolute men would keep well with all parties, and
could not refuse plainly and boldly: “ Pompeius hearing of Cicero’s coming
did not wait to see him, for he had a strong feeling of shame towards a
man who had made great efforts on his behalf, and had carried many
public mensures to please him, but as he was Caesar's son—in-laW, he
gave up old obligations at his request‚ and slipping out by a different
door evaded meeting with Cicero '' (Plutarch, Cicero, c. 31). The
