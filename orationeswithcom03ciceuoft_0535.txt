XXXIII. Hoc interim tempore P. Sestius, judices, designatus
iter ad C. Caesarem pro mea salute suscepit. Quid egerit, quan-
tum profecerit, nihil ad caussam :—equidem existimo, si ille, ut
arbitror, aequus nobis fuerit, nihil ab hoc profectum; sin iratior,
non multum :—sed tamen sedulitatem atque integritatem hominis
videtis. Ingredior jani in Sestii tribunatum :—na1n hoc primum
iter designatus rei publicae caussa suscepit: pertinere et ad con-
cordiam civium putavit et ad perficiendi facultatem animum Caesaris
a caussa non abhorrerez—abiit ille annus: respirasse homines

videbantur, nondum re, sed spe rei publicae recuperandae.

33. desiqnalus] ‘judex designatus ’ G.,
⁴ tribunus designatus,’ Car. Steph. prob.
Garat. (Halm). ‘ Designatus ’ is probablya
gloss. In B.c. 58 Caesar, after defeating the
Helvetii and the German Ariovistus, crossed
the Alps into Gallia Cisalpina to make his
circuits (⁶‘ad conventus agendos,’' B. G. i.
c. 54), and Sestius would find him at the
close of the year in North Italy.

ut arbitron] Orelli says that he signifies
by this word ‘ se non arbitrari.'

Inyrediorjam . . . tribunatum] Schiitz
and Madvig thought that these words should
be erased as having come from a rhetorical
gloss ⁴ ingreditur jam in Sestii tribunatum!
Others are of a different opinion. Spengel,
cited by Halm, has a good remark here. He
observes that at the end of c. 6 Cicero begins
to speak of the tribuneship of P. Sestius,
and says that he must tell all the shipwreck
of the state in the preceding year3 hav-
ing done this in cc. 7—32‚ and having men-
tioned the journey of P. Sestius to Caesar
when he was tribunus designatus, he now
begins the history of his tribunare: ⁴ Ingre-
dior jam,' διο. This is a complete answer
to the critics. This division into chapters
spoils the author. If the division had been
made by sensible men, this chapter would
begin ‘ Ingredior jam in Sestii tribunatum)

ad concordiam civium] It is said in the
letter of Cicero to Lentulus (Ad Fam. i. 9),
that Caesar did not oppose Cicero’s return ι
“ sese quae de mea salute egisset, volun-
tate Caesaris egisse ipsum meum fratrem
testatus est ’' (Manutius).

abiit ille annus . . . optimas perdidisse-
mus] Spengel, cited by Halm, thinks that
these words should be transposed and placed
after ‘de tabula sustulit 3’ “because nei-
ther the tribunes entered on their office on
the Calends of January, nor did the consuls
retire from office before that day.⁷’ Maehly
assumes that in this year the tribuni plebis
entered on their office after the time fixed

Ex-

by laW. Halm asks for the proof of this.
If Gabinius and Piso left Rome before the
tribuni plebis entered on their office, Cicero's
narrative will be in order, for he might say
that this year was really over when the two
consuls left Rome for their provinces, though
the first of January had not come. Cicero’s
narrative ought to mean that the consuls
left Rome before the end of the year.

sed spe rei publicae recuperandae] ‘ sed
spe re publica recuperata’ Lambinus', which
Madvig approves for this reason ε “ Primum
re et spe ita inter se referuntur constanti
usu, ut conjunctio spe reipublicae recupe-
randae (unam constituens notionem oppo'-
sitam vocabulo re) ferri nequeat; deinde,
ut haec isto modo intelligamus, quo pertinet
nudum illud re ? nam nondum re respirare
nihil est. Sane re (in der Wirlclz'chkeit)
respirabant, sed respirabant ob spem, non-
dum re effecta.'' Halm rejects this cor-
rection, and keeps the text, which he ex-
plains z ‘¹ men were beginning to think that
they had recovered their breath, not that
they really had restored, but because they
had hopes of restoring the state.’' No
doubt re and spe are opposed; but this
does not prevent the orator from telling us
what the hope was. That is the answer
to the first objection. And if we can under-
stand tbe passage so, aud are asked what
the bare ‘re' means, because ‘nondum re
respirare’ means nothing, the answer is,
that it is not ‘nondum re respirare,' but
‘respirasse videbantur,' a form of expres-
sion which is short of positive affirmation;
which is one of the most common forms of
expression, and we may correct it by some-
thing else. Cicero does it here by add-
ing ‘ nondum re‚' ¹ not yet really,' but only
in hope3 and then he tells us what the
hope is. The objection comes from a man
of authority, or it would not be worth re-
peating; but many of Madvig’s criticisms
are of the same kind. The emendation of
