quum omnes concessisset virtutes, scientiam petendi consulatus ademit ⁸?
Quid enim aliud esset, quo se victum homo nobilis et juris antistes magis
ferret? Ut vero rationem defensionis suae reddidit, quum se studuisse
petitioni Sulpicii contra honorem hffiurenae, non idem debere accusationi
contra caput, diceret? Quam molli autem articulo tractavit Catonem,
cujus naturam summe admiratus, non ipsius vitio sed Stoicae sectae
quibusdam in rebus factam duriorem videri volebat, ut inter eos non
forensem contentionem, sed studiosam disputationem crederes inci-
disse.’'

Cicero's defence of Murena is in reply to Cato and Sulpicius. He
begins with Cato (c. 2), and answers his complaint about Cicero, who
had himself carried a Lex de ambitu, undertaking the defence of a man
who was charged with bribery. He next (c. 3) answers Sulpicius, who
complained that Cicero, who was his friend and had helped him in his
canvass for the Consulship, now undertook the defence of his successful
competitor. The real matter of the charge against threna was divided
into three parts 3 of which one was an attack on his character, the
other was a comparison between his merit and that of Servius, and the
third was the charge of bribery‚ the only part, as we should suppose,
that it was necessary to answer (c. 5). Cicero employs a large part of
his speech in a comparison between Murena and servius, between the
soldier and the jurisconsultus 3 and in a comparison between the career
of the two rivals before qurena was elected consul (c. 7—20).

In c. 26 he begins to speak of the charge of bribery, and he says that
though it had been answered sufficiently by those who had spoken
before him, yet he will handle this matter again at the request of
Murena. The answer that he made to Cn. Postumius and to the
younger Servius does not appear in the editions of this speech, and
probably it may have been omitted by Cicero himself when he pub-
lished it.

In c. 28 he comes to Cato, whose character was such that Cicero
feared the weight of his name more than the strength of his charges
against Murena. What he says of Cato helps us to form an estimate
of the nian’s character. Cicero certainly respected him, even if he did
not like hi1n3 and he feared him too. At a later period, when Cicero
was governor of Cilicia, and wished to have a triumph for his little vic-
tories, Cato was the man whom he wished to conciliate, and he wrote to
him a long cajoling letter (Ad Div. xv. 4), to which Cato replied bluntly
in a letter of twenty lines, which he calls a longer letter than he usually
writes (Ad Div. xv. 5). Plutarch’s life of Cato is an excellent pertrait
of character, and those who will read it will understand this oration
better. “ When the trial camo on, Cicero who was then consul and one
of the advocates of Murena, on account of Cato's connexion with the
