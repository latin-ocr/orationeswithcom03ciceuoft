132 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

si nihil deliquerunt, dignitati eorum concessit, quum petere destitit.
Sin autem eorum aliquis largitus est, expetendus amicus est, qui
alienam potius injuriam quam suam persequatur.

XXVIII. Venio nunc ad M. Catonem, quod est firmamentum
ac robur totius accusationis; qui tamen ita- gravis est accusator et
vehemens ut multo magis ejus auctoritatem quam criminationem
pertimescam. In quo ego accusatore, judices, primum illud depre-
cabor, ne quid L. Murenae dignitas illius, ne quid expectatio tribu-
natus, ne quid totius vitae splendor et gravitas noceat, denique
ne ea soli huic obsint bona M. Catonis, quae ille adeptus est ut
multis prodesset. Bis consul fuerat P. Africanus et duos terrores
hujus imperii Karthaginem Numantiamque deleverat, quum accusa-
vit L. Cottam. Erat in eo summa eloquentia, summa fides, summa
integritas, auctoritas tanta, quanta in imperio populi Romani quod
illius opera tenebatur. Saepe hoc majores natu dicere audivi,
hanc accusatoris eximiam dignitatem plurimum L. Cottae profuisse.
Noluerunt sapientissimi homines, qui tum rem illam judicabant, ita
quemquam cadere in judicio ut nimiis adversarii viribus abjectus

videretur. Quid Ser. Galbam, nam traditum memoriae est, nonne

with something that did not suit him at all.

The practice of vaulting from one horse to

another is described even in Homer (Il. xv.

679). Ηο has four horses:

Θρώσκων ἄλλοτ’ ἐπ’ ἄλλον ἀμείβεται,
οὶ δὲ πέτονται.

 

Cicero says of Postumius : ‘¹ If his competi-
tors for the praetorship have done nothing
wrong, he yielded to their superior merit
when he ‹lesisted from his canvass. But if
any one of them has been guilty of bribery.
he must look for a friend who is ready to
avenge another person’s wrong rather than
his own.” This is said sareastically.

De Postumii] There is nothing in any
of the MSN'. under this liea‹l; and though
Cicero certainly said something, it appears
that he did not think it worth publishing.
In the passage of Pliny (Ep. i. 21») cited in
Vol. ΙΙ. (Pro Fonteio, (τ. 9), this oration for
Murena is one of those which Pliny meu-
tions as differing iu its published from its
spoken form.

28. qnod est] This is a form not un-
usual in Cicero. ‘Quod ⁷ refers to the

nouns which follow.—‘ qui tamen ita:’
“ and though he is a weighty and powerful
prosecutor, I dread the authority of his
name much more than his charge.’' When
‘ita-ut’ occur, it is often necessary to
change the form of expression in transla-
tion, or we shall not get the meaning.
There are more ways than one of doing it.
The following instance will show the neces-
sity of varying the form in English ε “ Nos
ita te desideramus ut amemus,’' and he
explains it thus : “ Amor ut valentem videa-
mus hortatur; desiderium, ut quam pri-
mum ’⁷ (Cicero, Ad Fam. xvi. l).

This affair of Cotta is spoken of in another
place (Vol. I. Divin. c. 2¹, note).

Ser. Galbam] Cicero does not mention
his crime, which was great. Ser. Sulpicius
Galba during his practorship iu Spain ac-
cepted the surrender of many thousand
Lusitani; but. contrary to liis promise. 110
put some to death and sold others for slaves.
L. Scribonius Libo (uc. 149) endeavoured
to bring the man to justice, but as this was
