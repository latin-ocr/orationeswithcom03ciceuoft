ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 5

for stirring up the slaves in the city, for setting fire to Rome, and gain-
ing over their husbands or killing them. One of these women bore the
noble name Sempronia. She was of high birth, handsome‚ happy in her
husband and her children. Her husband, D. Jnnius Brutus, had been
consul in B.c. 77. She was versed in Greek and Roman literature3
could play on the lute, dance with grace, and she possessed all the
talents by which a woman can please. She wrote verses, and was witty
in conversation, which she could snit to any occasion. She was altoge-
ther a pleasing and seducing companion. But this woman was a profli-
gate sensualist, who spent her money as freely as she threw away her
reputation, who sought her lovers if they did not come to her. The
young Romans who formed Catilina’s train were seduced by his promises
and by the women whom he found for them. Beggared spendthrifts‚ de-
cayed nobles, soldiers who had got a fortune by plunder and had spent
it, bad wives and profligate women, were the motley crew that Catilina
got about him.

Catilina still hoped for the consulship, and in Β.0. 63 he renewed 1113
canvass for the consulship of the following year. If he could be elected,
he hoped to manage Antonius as he pleased, and to be more than a
match for the consul Cicero (Sallust, Cat. 0. 26). Ηο would have
assassinated Cicero if he could3 but the consul was as watchful as
Catilina, and a great deal more cunning. By large promises (Sallust,
Cat. c. 26), made through Fulvia, and we may assume by large pay-
ments too, Q. Curius was bribed to betray to Cicero 311 the designs of
Catilina. Cicero kept his collcague C. Antonius quiet by agreeing to
give up to him his own province, that which Cicero was entitled to have
at the expiration of his consulship. He provided for his persona] safety
by getting round himself a body of friends and clients, who served him
like a secret police (In Cat. iii. c. 2). Cicero also carried a new Lex on
bribery at elections (lex de ambitu), the obJect of which was to make
still severer the penalties of the Lex Calpurnia de ambitu (Pro hlurena,
c. 323 Schol. Bob. ad Or. pro Sulla, p. 362). This Lex was directed
against Catilina. The Senate also deferred the Consular Comitia to the
twenty-first of October. But Catilina still 'prosecuted his canvaSS.
His hopes rested on the consulship (Pro 1111110113, c. 24).

On the twentieth of October Cicero addressed the Senate on the
danger with which the State was threatened by a conspiracy. The
Senate resolved that the Comitia should not bc held on 1110 following
day, but that they would ou that day take into consideration the state
of the lintion. On the twenty-first of October Cicero, in the presence
of Catilina, exposed to the Senate the designs of the conspirators.
Catilina, as Cicero tells us (Pro Murena, 0. 25), did not attempt to clear
himself: he said that the State consisted of two bodies, the one weak
