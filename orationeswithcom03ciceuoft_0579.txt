studio elatus, tamen ignosceret nemo: quum vero ne de venalibus
quidem homines electos, sed ex ergastulis emptos nominibus gla-
diatoriis ornarit et sortito alios Samnites, alios provocatores fecerit,
tanta licentia, tanta legum contemptio, nonne quem habitura sit
exitum pertimescit? Sed habet defensiones duas: primum, “ Do,
inquit, bestiarios: lex est scripta de gladiatoribus.” Festive!
Accipite aliquid etiam acutius. Dicet se non gladiatores, sed unum
gladiatorem dare et totam aedilitatem in munus hoc transtulisse.
Praeclara aedilitas! unus leo, ducenti bestiarii. Verum utatur
hac defensione: cupio eum suae causae confidere: solet enim tri-
bunos plebis appellare et vi judicium disturbare quum diffidit.
Quem non tam admiror, quod meam legem contemnit, ,hominis ini-
mici, quam quod sic statuit omnino consularem legem nullam
putare. Caeciliam Didiam, Liciniam J uniam contempsit. Etiamne

satisfy the people, after finding that the peo-
ple had not been favourable to him in his
canvass for the aedileship (Manutius).

de venalibus] He did not take even the
best slaves that the market offered, but
he had rnen from the t ergastula‚' worn out
with labour, good for nothing except to be
killed; for when a slave was no longer fit
for work, he was still able to eat and would
cost his master something. It was cheaper
therefore to have him killed, and better
still to 5011 him to be killed. On the Er-
gastula, see Vol. IL, Index.

sortito] He chose by lot some to be
Samnites and some to be ‘provocatores,⁷
the exact meaning of which last word 15
doubtful, The names Provocatores and
Provocantes occur on inscriptions (Klotz) 3
who observes “ they were called challengers,
because they were bold enough to challenge
any one out of the band of gladiators to
single combat, and for that purpose also
were especially well armed and trained.⁷'
Lipsius (Op. Saturn. Serm. ii. 0. 7, διο.)
1135 3 treatise on the Roman gladiators.
Halm quotes Livy (ix. 40> z ‘⁴ Campani ab
superbia et odio Samnitium gladiatores,
quod spectaculu m interepulas erat, eo ornatu
armarunt Samnitiumque nomine compel-
larunt.'’ Horace has an allusion to the
Samnites:

‘⁴ Caedimur, et totidem plagis consumimus
LeliizbnStgmnites ad lumina prima duello.”
(Ep. ii. 2. 98, and Macleane's note.)

Cicero (Tuscul. ii. 17), where he is speaking
of the gladiator’s endurance‚ quotes the
line :

“ Samnis, spurcus homo, vita illa dignu’
locoque.⁷’

Lipsius (Saturn. ii. c. 1 1) 1135 311 aboutthese
Samnites.

bestiarios] These were gladiators who
fought with wild 1103515-ι totam aedilita-
tem :' “that is, all the eost which he would
have expended on the Ludi, if he had got
the aedileship, he transferred to this ex-
hibition '’ (Schiitz).

unus leo,] He admitted that there was
one gladiator, whose name was Len, and
two hundred men opposed to the beasts
(Schol.); who adds: “Hoc etiam dictum
de Leone Tullius Tiro, libertus ejusdem,
inter jocos Ciceronis adnumeratJ’ Cicero’s
jokes would have filled a volume ; and some-
times they were good.

tribanos pl. appellare] ‘⁴ Vatinius quum
reus de ambitu fieret, appellavit collegium
tribunorum et maxime P. Clodium, quo
intercedente effectum est ut accusatio, quae
suscepta fuerat, non posset impleri’'
(Schol.). Halm refers to In Vatin. c. 14.

sic statuit] Madvig, Halm (2); ⁴ si sta-
tuit ’ P1.; ⁴ se statuit ’ ΡΒ. G. Wesenberg
compares Pro Cluentio, c. 16: “Itaque
tum sic statuit . . . insidias Habito com-
parare.''

Caeciliam Didiam] “ Caecilia est autem
et Didia quae jubebat in promulgandis
legibus trinundinum tempus observari.
Licinia vero et Junia coss. auctoribus Lici-
nio Murena et ι1111110 Silano perlata illud
cavebat, ne clam aerario legem ferri <Halm
suggests ‘inferri ') liceret, quoniam leges
in aerario condebantur ’' (Schol.).
