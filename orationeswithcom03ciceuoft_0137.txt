gratiam aequitatis largitio: qua in sorte sapiens praetor, qualis hic
fuit, offensionem vitat aequabilitate decernendi, benevolentiam ad-
jungit lenitate audiendi. Egregia et ad consulatum apta provincia,
in qua laus aequitatis, integritatis, facilitatis ad extremum ludorum
voluptate concluditur. Quid tua sors? tristis, atrox: quaestio
peculatus, ex altera parte lacrimarum et squaloris, ex altera plena
catenarum atque indicum. Cogendi judices inviti, retinendi contra
voluntatem: scriba damnatus, ordo totus alienus: Sullana gratifi-
catio reprehensa, multi viri fortes, et prope pars civitatis offensa
est: lites severe aestimatae: cui placet, obliviscitur: cui dolet,
meminit. Postremo tu in provinciam ire noluisti. Non possum id
in te reprehendere, quod in me ipso et praetore et consule probavi.
Sed tamen L. Murenae provincia multas bonas gratias culn optima
existimatione attulit. Habuit proficiscens dilectum in Umbria:
dedit ei facultatem res publica liberalitatis, qua usus multas sibi
tribus, quae municipiis Umbriae conficiuntur, adjunxit. Ipse autem
in Gallia, ut nostri homines desperatas jam pecunias exigerent
aequitate diligentiaque perfecit. Tu interea Romae scilicet amicis
praesto fuisti. Fateor: sed tamen illud cogita, nonnullorum ami-

quaeslio peculatus] The praetors, ex-

bria‚ and he used his authority in such a
cept the ‘urbanus' and ‘peregrinus‚’ dis-

way as to gain the good will of the towns

tributed the Quaestiones among them by
lot. Servius had to try matters of Pecu-
latus, or misappropriation of public money ;
a disagreeable business for an honourable
:man to spend his time in looking into
knaves' dirty tricks.

scriba damnata-33] Not one ‘scriba’
only perhaps 3 but the conviction of a single
‘scriba' would alienate the whole order,
which was power-ful enough to prevent the
election of Servius. See In (tat. iv. c. 7,
and Vol. Ι. Verr. II. 3. c. 79, Scriba.

Sullana] Sulla rewarded liis men with
lands and money, the produce of proscrip-
tion and murder. Some of his men were
called to account after his death, and it
seems lost their ill-gotten wealth3 for ‘re-
prehensa' means that these grants were
called in question. Cicero says in his long
letter to Quintus (Ad Q. Fr. i. l. c. 7):
‘⁴ Cogebantur Sullani homines quae per vim
et metum abstulerant reddere.”

lites] ⁴ Damages were strictly assessed'
‘Lis’ is not only the suit, but the ‘aesti-
matio litis: the fixing of the damages or
penalty which the defendant must pay.

provincia] Murena had the province of
Gallia Trmisalpina after his praetorship.
lle was empowered to raise troops in Um-

(municipia) ofUmbria, which were included,
as it seems, in various tribes, and helped to
compose them (conficere).

desperatas] The Romans, and particu-
larly the equites, had placed their money
in Gallia, and they had debts which were
desperate (desperatae). Murena¹ like other
Roman governors, did what he could to
effect a settlement of these claims and to
help his Roman friends to their money.
Gallia was a country in which the Roman
employed his capital: “ Referta Gallia ne-
gotiatorum est, plena civium Romanorum.
Nemo Gallorum sine cive Romano quid-
quam negotii gerit: nummus in Gallia
nullus sine civium Romanorum tabulis
movetur’' (Pro Fonteio, c. 5. Vol. IL).—
‘ipse autem' is the Mss. reading, for
which Ernesti wrote ‘ipsa‚’ and Halm has
followed. ‘Ipsa’ makes an opposition bc-
tween Umbria and Gallia 3 but ⁴ ipre ' makes
an opposition between what Murena did
unaided in Gallia, and what the >tate enabled
him to do in Umbria (dedit ei facultatem
res publiea). Klotz understood it right.
Some editions have attho end os 1 his chapter
the false reading ⁴intelliga11t.’ There is no
meaning in a subjunctive there.
