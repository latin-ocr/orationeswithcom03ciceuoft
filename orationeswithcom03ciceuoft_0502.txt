488 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

memoria etiam mortuorum. Quia tristem semper, quia taciturnum,
quia subhorridum atque incultum videbant, et quod erat eo nomine
ut ingenerata familiae frugalitas videretur, favebant, gaudebant, et
ad integritatem majorum spe sua hominem vocabant materni generis
obliti. Ego autem—vere dicam, judices,—tantum esse in homine
sceleris, audaciae, crudelitatis, quantum ipse cum re publica sensi,
numquam putavi. Nequam esse hominem et levem et falsa opinione
errore hominum ab adolescentia commendatum sciebam. Etenim
animus ejus vultu, flagitia parietibus tegebantur3 sed haec ob-

eo nomine . . .sru9alitas] ‘⁴ Because he
had a name (Frugi) which might be con-
sidered as evidence of the innate ‘ frugalitas ’
of the ‘ familias '’ Manutius observes that
Cicero is alluding to the name Frugi. Dru-
mann (Geschichte Roms, ii. 62) says that
neither was this L. Piso Caesoninus, one of
the consuls of B.c. 58, nor were his de-
scendants named Frugi; nor was any Frugi
called Caesoninus, for these were the two
names by which these Calpurnii were dis-
tinguished. Asconius is mistaken when he
calls this Piso a Frugi: “no coin, no in-
scription, and no writer speaks for him,
not even Cicero himself, who according to
his practice would have tired us with the
repetition of the name in drawing the por-
trait of his opponent.⁷' He adds, ⁴ familia '
here means fami1y3 and Cicero intends to
say: “people were deceived in him, they
supposed in all the Calpurnii and conse-
quently in him those virtues were innate
which the mention of his ‘familia' sug-
gested. This interpretation is confirmed
by Cicero’s style of addressing him: ‘O
familiae non dicam Calpurniae, sed Calven-
tiae ’ (In Pison. c. 23), and in his abusive
speeches he never names him Calpurnius
but Calventius, and often alludes to his
Gallie descent.'’ Piso’s father married Cal-
ventius’ daughter (Quum Senatui, c. 6, note,
and c. 7). Halm supposes that Cicero may
mean this: As his name was Piso, the ‘fru-
galitas ' of the family of the Pisones might
have been supposed to belong to him also,
since the most illustrious of the Pisones
were both Frugi and were called Frugi. In
this explanation ⁴ nomen ’ means the cogno-
men of the ‘familia,’ as in Verr. iv. 25:
‘⁴ nimirum ut hic (Verres) nomen suum com-
probavit, sic ille (L. Piso Frugi) cognomen ”
(Halm).—‘ frugalitas :’ see Vol. I. Index.

acl z'nteqritatem majorum] They hoped
that he would be as honest as his ancestors.
Halm compares Cicero, De Sen. c. 19:
“sensi ego in optimo filio meo, tuin ex-

pectatis ad amplissimam dignitatem fratri-
bus tuis, Scipio.’'—‘ materni generis:' his
Gallie descent on his mother’s side (Quum
Senatui, c. 6).

in homine] “Nam de Pisone uno, neuti-
quam de universo hominum genere intelligo.
Sic De Rep. ξ 1; de Orat. i. 7. Aliis locis
Ciceronis tamen in lzoc homine ut Verr. ii.
l. ξ 10 (Muell.). Addo ex hac ipsa ora-
tione c. 24 ⁴ furori hominis;’ c. 41, ‘animi
hominis.' v. Kritz ad Sal. Jug. c. 70. p.
377 3 Fab. ad Liv. 24. c. 43 Klotz ad Tusc.
D. 1. ξ 49. p. 59” (Halm). There are
many notes in Halm’s edition which arc
like this. It would be rather difficult to
make the mistake which Mueller tells us
not to make. ‘ Homo' is often used em-
phatically (Pro Quintio, c. 4, note, Vol. IL).

numquam putavi] '“ Ich hatte nie ge-
glaubt.''-—I could never have believed it,
is Halm’s German versi0n; who observes
that the Latini properly use the indica-
tive. The indicative is the right mood,
because it says directly what is meant, and
the other form does n0t; but we can say,
‘¹ I never thought there was so much vil·
lainy in the man, as I and the Res Publica
found out by experience.''

salsa opinione errore] A comma is
usually placed after ‘opinione ς’ but the
little mark does not help us to the sense.
There have been various opinions about the
meaning of the passage. The true ex-
planation is that of a certain learned man,
name untold, who explained it thus to
Halm: “ Ι knew that the man had been
recommended by a false opinion of him
through men’s erroneous judgment of his
youth,” i. e. “propterea quod homines
adolescentia ejus in fraudem induxerat.”
The way in which he spent his youth, or the
apparent character of his youth misled peo-
ple; ‘⁴ for‚’' he continues, ‘⁴ his mind was
concealed in his face, his scandalous acts by
the walls of his house.''
