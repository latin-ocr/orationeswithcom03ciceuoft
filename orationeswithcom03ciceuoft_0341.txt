INTRODUCTION

ΤΟ THE

ORATIO QUUM POPULO.

THIS speech is very like the other. It is, as Markland observes, a kind
of abridgment of it, for not only the matter, but the words in many
parts are the same. A man reading the first will think it bad enough,
but when he gets to the second, he will find it is only the first made
worse¹. Manutius supposed that Cicero wrote it only, and did not
deliver it, because he does not mention it in the letter to Atticus (iv. 1),
where he mentions the other. But Dion Cassius (39. c. 9) says that
Cicero addressed a speech of thanks both to the Senate and to the
People. Wolf observes that if Dion had not mentioned this fact, or if
this speech were not extant, scarcely any person could have supposed
that Cicero had thanked the people from the Rostra. He adds that this
letter (iv. 1) seems to show that he did not make a speech to the
Quirites like that to the Senate. The facts, as Cicero tells them to
Atticus, are these: On the day after his return, which day was the
Nonae Septembres, Cicero thanked the Senate in the speech before this,
or in another, which we have not. There was great dearness of pro-
visions, and the people were clamorous about the Senate-house. The
Senate had the question of the high prices before them3 every body
said that Pompeius should be appointed to look after supplies of corn,
and the people called on Cicero to propose a Senatusconsultum to that
effect. He did 803 and a S. C. was made to this purport, that Pompeius
should be asked to undertake a matter, which he was very eager to have

two other examples of repetition are cited by Markland, who says that they are scarcely
one sixth part, as an attentive reader will discover. Cicero’s invention had been dried up
in his exile. It was all lost by crying.
