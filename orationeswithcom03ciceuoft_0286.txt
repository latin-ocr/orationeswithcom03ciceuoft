272 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

pete a Deciano, non pecuniam, non praedia, socrum denique sibi
habeat: restituat uxorem, reddat misero patri filiam. Membra
quae debilitavit lapidibus, fustibus, ferro, manus quas contudit,
digitos quos confregit, nervos quos concidit, restituere non potest:
filiam, filiam, inquam, aerumnoso patri, Deciane, redde. Haec
Flacco non probasse te miraris? Cui, quaeso, tandem probasti?
Emptiones falsas, praediorum proscriptiones cum mulieribus aperta
circumscriptione fecisti. Tutor his [rebus] Graecorum [legibus]
ascribendus fuit. Polemocratem scripsisti, mercenarium et ad-
ministrum consiliorum tuorum. Adductus est in judicium Pole-
mocrates de dolo malo et· de fraude a Dione, hujus ipsius tutelae
nomine. Qui concursus ex oppidis finitimis undique, qui dolor ani-
morum, quae querela? Condemnatus est Polemocrates sententiis
omnibus: irritae venditiones, irritae proscriptiones. Num resti-
tuis? Defers ad Pergamenos, ut illi reciperent in suas litteras
publicas praeclaras proscriptiones et emptiones tuas. Repudiant,
rejiciunt. At qui homines? Pergameni, laudatores tui. Ita enim
mihi gloriari visus es laudatione Pergamenorum, quasi honorem
majorum tuorum assecutus esses3 et hoc te superiorem esse putabas

scriptiones ι’ notices ofsale. Decianus did 10). A Testamentum was ‘irritum' in

this in conjunction with the silly women,
whom he had deceived. The knavery or
fraud (circmnscriptio) was manifest. See
Pro Ros. Com. c. 8, note on ‘circum-
scriptum.' Cicero often makes a contrast
or play on words. as he does here. The
‘ proscriptiones ' were effected ¹ circumscrip-

Tutor Itis . . . Graecorum] ‘ Tutor his

not tell from Baiter what the MSS. have.
Faernus says ‘ab omnibus fere libris abest
dictio lembus! He thought that we should
read ‘moribus ’ for ⁴ rebus.⁷ There is no
doubt that Cicero intends to say that the
women could not sell the lands without the
concurrence of some man who represented
the Roman Tutor. (Pro Caecina, c. 25,
Vol. Il.) Klotz quotes Isaeus (Περὶ τοῦ
Ἀριστάρχου κλήρου, c. 4) as authority for
the rule of law at Athens that no woman
could make a contract above the value of a
medimnus of barley : ὁ γάρ 1»(’),1ιοςὸια(’)ῥίμ”ῖην

γυναικὶ πέρα μεδίμνου κριθῶν. Τ118 rule
was not bad.

The sales were declared void (irritae), and
the notices for sale also went for nothing.

certain cases.

ad Peryamenos,] This was a kind of
appeal. Decianus carried the matter to
the chief town of the ‘conventus’ and
asked to 'have the sale registered in the
register office of Pergamum (litterae pub-
lieae). These towns had register offices
(ἀρχεῖα) for sales and mortgages. The
registration at Pergamum would have con-
firmed the sale, as we must suppose.—
⁸ honorem :’ the ‘ honos ’ is a Roman magis-
tracy. “Majores tui fuerunt honorati
Romae, tu mavis vivere in Asia’' (Came-
rarius).—‘ consecutus esses,' Klotz, Baiter.

superiorem] Klotz supposes that there
had been a disputo between Laelius and
Decianus about priority as prosecutors (de
constituendo accusatore) ; and that Laelius
was preferred because he had the Smyrnaei
on his side3 and yet these Smyrnaei had
made themselves ridiculons by the honours
that they paid 10 0110 Castricius who died
there; honours greater than the Pergameni
paid 10 P. Scipio Nasica, the Pontifex
Maximus, who led the route that killed Ti.
Gracchus, and afterwards retired to Per-
gamum where he died (Plutarch, Ti Grac-
chus, c. 21). Klotz further supposes that
