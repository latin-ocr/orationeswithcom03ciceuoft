26 ORAT. I. IN L. CATILINAM

dixisti? a quo non receptus etiam ad me venire ausus es, atque ut
domi meae te asservarem rogasti. Quum a me quoque id respon-
sum tulisses, me nullo modo posse iisdem parietibus tuto esse
tecum, qui magno in periculo essem quod iisdem moenibus con-
tineremur, ad Q. Metellum praetorem venisti. A quo repudiatus,
ad sodalem tuum, virum optimum, M. Metellum demigrasti3 quem
tu videlicet et ad custodiendum [te] diligentissimum, et ad suspican-
dum sagacissimum, et ad vindicandum fortissimum fore putastis
Sed quam longe videtur a carcere atque 3 vinculis abesse debere,
qui se ipse jam dignum custodia judicarit? Quae quum ita sint,
Catilina, dubitas, si emori aequo 31111110 11011 potes, abire in aliquas
terras, et vitam istam multis suppliciis justis debitisque ereptam
fugae solitudinique mandare?

Refer, inquis, ad senatum: id enim postulas, et, si hic ordo
placere [sibi] decreverit te ire in exsilium, obtemperaturum te esse

he says: “Ad et apud accusativae sunt
praepositiones. Sed apud semper in loco
significat, Ad et 111 loco et ad locum, ut
Ad quem tum Juno supplex his vocibus
usa est: et Cicero, Decem fiscos ad Sena-
torem quendam relictos (Vol. Ι. Verr. Act
i. c. 8): item 3 Ad Marcum Leccam te ha-
bitare velle dixisti.” The name of Marcus
Lecca is 311 error. “ Of the MSS. of Cicero
only one, but that is the best (Lagomarsini,
62) confirms the testimony of the gramma-
rians. The rest have ‘mutis’ (Halm.)

qui—essem] “ For l was in great danger

13.c.60. On the news reaching Rome of
Manlius occupying Faesulae, Q. Metellus
Celer was sent into Picenum with authority
to raise troops against the conspirators
(Sallust, Cat. c. 30). When Catilina led
his men into the territory of Pistoria with
the intention of taking 111010 by mountain
roads over 1110 Λ1101101005 11110 Gallia Cis-
alpina, Metcllus 1001011 10 1110 foot of the
Apcnnincs and occupied 1110 ground at the
point where Catilina must come down.
Metellus was in Catilina's rcar, and as
there was no hope of escape, he facud about
and fought Antonius (Cat. 57).

Dion Cassius (37, c. 31) says, that on
1110 arrival of 1110 news from Etruria, the
consuls wcrc unipowcrcd hy 1110 sorni ⁴ Da-

01101011 10 pnt himself ‘in libera custodia’
with (sit-ero (τῷ Κικέρωνι αὐτῷ τηρεῖν
ἑαυτὸν, ὅπως δι’] μή φεύγῃ που, παρ-

εδιὸου). Cicero refused to take him, and he
went and lived with Metellus, the praetor.
In most of the MSS. of Cicero and in the
common editions, M. Marcellus is named

as the ‘honest’ man into whose hands Cati· Χ

lina put himself. Halm in his edition of
1851 reads ⁴ ad M. Marcellum demigrasti,'
but in the edition of 1854 (Orelli⁷s 2nd
ed.) he reads ‘ad M. Metellum demigrasti‚'
which is the reading of the Cod. Med. num-
bercd 62 by Lagomarsini, and the reading
of the MSS. of Quintilian (ix. 2, 45), who
cites the words ‘optimum virum’ as an
example of irony, but he cites the name
¹ Metellum ’ without 3 ⁴ praenomen.’

It is conjectured that M. Marcellus was
the father of C.. Marcellus, who was ma-
nagin affairs for Catilina in Capua, and
was §riveti out of the place by P. Sestius
on the order of Cicero (Pro P. Sestio, e. 4).
Orosius (vi. 6) speaks of some disturbance
being made among the Peligni by the 'Mar-
celli, father and son, but it was ehecked
aster the discovery of Catilina’s conspiracy:
he adds, “et de utroque per Bibulum in
Pelignis, per Ciceronem in Bruttiis vindica-
tum est.'’ But all this is very uncertain.
The man whom Cicero shortly afterwards
calls ‘ fortissimo viro, M. Marcello,' cannot
be thc ‘virum optimum, M. Marcellum'
whom he is 5000111111,Γ at. It 500015, then,
