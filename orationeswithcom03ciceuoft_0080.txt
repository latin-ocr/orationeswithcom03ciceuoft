66 ORAT. ΙΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

jam ab Lentulo ceterisque domesticis hostibus tam dementer tantae
res, creditae et ignotis et barbaris, commissaeque litterae numquam
essent profect0‚ nisi ab diis immortalibus huic tantae audaciae con-
silium esset ereptum. Quid vero? ut homines Galli ex civitate
male pacata, quae gens una restat quae populo Romano bellum
facere et posse et non nolle videatur, spem imperii et rerum amplis-
simarum ultro sibi a patriciis hominibus oblatam negligerent, ves-
tramque salutem suis opibus anteponerent, id non divinitus factum
esse putatis; praesertim qui nos non pugnando sed tacendo supe-
rare potuerint?

X. Quamobrem, Quirites, quoniam ad omnia pulvinaria suppli-
catio decreta est, celebratote illos dies cum conjugibus ac liberis
vestris. Nam multi saepe honores diis immortalibus justi habiti
sunt ac debiti, sed profecto justiores numquam. Erepti enim estis
ex crudelissimo ac miserrimo interitu, [et] erepti sine caede, sine
sanguine, sine exercitu, sine dimicatione: togati me uno togato
duce et imperatore vicistis. Etenim recordamini, Quirites, omnes
civiles dissensiones, neque solum eas quas audistis, sed et eas quas
vosmetipsi meministis atque vidistis. L. Sulla P. Sulpicium op-
pressit: ejecit ex urbe C. Marium, custodem hujus urbis, multosque

the command in the Mithridatio war from
Sulla to Marius. Sulla, who was still 111

alpine Galli was necessary to secure the
tranquillity of Italy, and there was a man

in Rome ready to do the work ; and he did
it. In B.c. 58 C. Caesar had for his Pro-
vincia Gallia Cisalpina and Gallia north of
the Alps, with a commission that empow-
ered him to carry the Roman arms as far
as he could (Caesar, B. G. i. 353 Cicero,
De Provinciis Consul., c. 13).

superarepotuerint?] ‘ Potuerint ' is Mad-
vig’s emendation. One MS. omits ‘prae-
sertim— potuerunt) As all the MSS. have
‘potuerunt,’ and “ cum sententia languida
sit,'⁷ says Halm, hc will not object to any
body striking out the words from ‘prae-
sertim ' to ⁴ potuerunt) But it is no more
languid than many hundred sentences in
Cicero. It seems to me well said.

10 pulvinaria] A ‘pulvinar ' was a sofa on
which the statues of the gods were placed,
when a ‘lectisternium' was made on the
occasion of a ‘ supplicatio) Livy says (2⁶2.
c. l): “ Decretum—uti supplicatio per tri-
duum ad onmia pulvinaria hal)‹·retur.''
‘Pulvinar,’ says Servius (Virg. Geor-g. iii.
5323) is “lectulus in quo deorum statua re-
clinabatur.’⁷ See Horace, Carm. i. 37.

P. Sulpicium] This tribune P. Sulpicius
Rufus was of the Marian faction. 111 11.(;.
88 110 proposed a Lex for the transfer of

Italy and near Rome, attacked the city with
his soldiers, broke into it, and proscribed
Sulpicius and others (Plutarch, Sulla, e. 8,
&c.; Appian, Β. C. i. (50). Sulpicius was
caught in the marshes of Laurentum, and
his head was fus-ed on the Rostra, a sign of
what was going to come (Vell. Pat. ii. 19).
“Sulpicius,'’ says Cicero (Brutus, c. 55)
“ was 0110 of the most dignified orators that
Ι have heard, and so to speak the most
tragic. His voice was powerful, sweet, and
elear; his gesture and the movements of
his body graceful, and yet it seemed that
he was trained to the forum and not to the
stage; his language was vehement and flow-
ing, and yet not redundant nor loose”
Such was one of the great orators who
grew up in the stormy times of the Repub-
lic: “ cui quidem ad summam gloriam
eloquentiae florescenti ferro vita erepta est,
et poena temeritatis non sine magno rei
publicae malo constituta est.’' (Cic. Or. iii.
3.) He speaks in the same terius of him
again (Or. i. 29). Ρ. Sulpicius is one of
thu speakers 111 Cicero’s Dialogue De Ora-
tore.
