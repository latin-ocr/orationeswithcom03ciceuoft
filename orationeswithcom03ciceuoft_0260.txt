246 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

sentur testimonii denuntiatione deterret : egentes et leves spe lega-
tionis et viatico publico, privata etiam benignitate prolectat. Opi-
fices et tabernarios, atque illam omnem faecem civitatum, quid est
negotii concitare, in eum praesertim qui nuper summo cum imperio
fuerit, summo autem in amore esse propter nomen ipsum imperii
non potuerit? Mirandum vero est homines eos quibus odio sunt
nostrae secures, nomen acerbitati, scriptura, decumae, portorium
morti, libenter arripere facultatenf laedendi quaecumque detur.
Mementote igitur, quum audietis psephismata, non audire vos testi-
monia3 audire temeritatem vulgi, audire vocem levissimi cujusque,
audire strepitum imperitorum, audire contionem concitatam levis-
simae nationis. Itaque perscrutamini penitus naturam rationemque
criminum: jam nihil praeter spem, nihil praeter terrorem ac minas

reperietis.

8. spe leqatiom's] Cicero represents this
excellent young man, D. Laelius, as seducing
the needy and men without character by
the hope of being sent to Rome as mem-
bers of a ‘legatio,' with an allowance for the
journey. The ‘legatio‚’ a word which in its
collective sense corresponds to ‘advocatio'
(a body of ‘advocati ²), would be sent by the
town and at the town eost to give evidence
against Flaccus, to convey to Rome as evi-
dence the ‘psephismata’ of cobblers and
tailors. We see from this and other pas-
sages how expensive these trials at Rome
must have been (Pro Fonteio, Introduc-
tion), expensive to the provincials, and
sometimes to the defendant.

nomen ipsum imperii] The very name of
the authority which the governor has pre-
vents him from being much loved. In the
letter to Quintus (i. l. ll) Cicero speaks of
the ‘ nomen publicani :’ “ Quare nomen
publicani neque ii debent horrere qui sem-
per veetigales fuerunt,” διε.

scriptura, . . . νων-ἰὴ] He mentions the
three great branches of Roman revenue in
the provinces: “the Roman fasces were
hateful, the Roman name was bitter in the
mouth, the scripturae, decumae, portorium
were death.’' For once at least he has
told us the truth. They hated the Roman
taxation like death.

spemn] There is also a reading ‘ speeiem,’
or rather ‘spetiem,' which Klotz has and
explains thus: If the Judices examinul
well the charges against Flaccus, they would

find them to contain only idle show, nothing
but idle terrors and mere threats; in short,
that there is nothing behind them.—He ob-
serves that Garatoni had already rightly
understood the passage, and that ‘ spem’
cannot be explained. Baiter has followed
Klotz. If ⁴ spem ' is right, Cicero says,
‘⁶ You will find nothing in the charges ex-
cept the hopes of those who make them,
nothing except their attempts to srighten
115, and their threats.” After what he has
said in this chapter the conclusion seems to
me very plain3 and it is made still plainer
by a passage in c. 10: “ nego esse ista tes-
timonia, quae tu ipse psephismata appellas,
sed fremitum egentium, et motum quendam
temerarium Graeculae contionis.” Why
does he say ‘ egentiuni,' ‘the noise of needy
fellows ?’ Because they expected to be paid
for their sweet voices.

9. In aerario] The transition is abrupt,
and it has been supposed that something
has been lost; and in some editions we find
printed ‘⁶ Deesse videntur nonnulla.” Baiter
observes that Mai has shown from the
Seholiast that nothing is wanting, and Klotz
says that it is all right. The states of Asia,
says Cicero, have no money in the treasury,
none in their revenues. There are two ways
of making up a sum of money, either by
borrowing (versura) or by 3 tax (tributo).
Still we may ask, how is this connected
with what precedes ? The Scholiast has
the following remark on the words ⁴ In
aerario . . . vectigalibus :¹ ‘⁴ materiam nul-
