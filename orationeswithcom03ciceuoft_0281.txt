Metello] Here we learn why all these
‘ laudationes’ came from Graecia. Flaccus
had served asa ¹ legatus’ of Metellus Creticus,
it is said. Cicero says ‘ Achaia cuncta,’ and
he then mentions Boeotia and Thessalia as
not included in ‘ Achaia cuncta.’ Sigonius
assumed that Achaia was formed into a
Roman province in B.c. 146, after the con-
quest of Corinth by Mummius, K. F.
Hermann of late years has attempted to
show that there is no evidence of the ex-
istence of a province Achaia before ‘she time
of Augustus. The subject is perplexcd‚
and though there is no direct evidence to
support Sigonius’ opinion, there are many
arguments in favour of it, Cicero however
does not call it a Provincia here. It seems
to have been under the government of a
Propraetor or proconsul together with
Thessalia and Boeotia. Servius Sulpicius
was governor of Achaia in B.c. 45 (Cicero,
Ad Div. xiii. 2103 and Boeotia was within
his jurisdiction (Ad Div. iv. 12). Cicero
gives us no information of the extent of
Achaia as he understood it, but we must
assume that it comprised at. least Attica
and Megaris and the Peloponnesus. The

province of Achaia is discussed in Becker's
Handbuch, continued by Marqumdt, vol. iii.

Blassilia,] See Pro M. Fonteio, c. 5.
It seems that Flaccus had been a ‘ quaestor '
in the Gallia Provincia. Gulielmius pro-
posed to read ‘ tribunum militum' in place
of ‘militem,’ and he refers to c. 40. His
conjecture is ingenious and probable. Cicero
praises the aristocratic constitution of Mas-
silia. The power was in the hands of the
‘selecti et principes‚’ who are the ‘opti-
mates’ (Cicero, De Re Pub. i. 27, 28).
Strabo (p. 179) has some remarks on the
constitution of Massilia. This city, which
retained its good manners for a long time,
was the place where Julius Agricola, the
conqueror ot' Britain, was cducated (Tacitus,
Agric. c. 4).

¹27. curm-ia] Perhaps it should be ‘ cura-
rit.'—— Cicero adopts the usual threesold divi-
sion of the Hellenic people, Ionians, Aeo-
lians, and Dori-ans, who occupied the western
sea-coast Of Asia Minor, where they planted
their colonies in the countries called Aeolis,
Ionia, and Doris—⁸ habebatur:¹ ‘ habetur,'
