habeant judicum.

P. Servilius,] De Domo, c. 16.

L. Claudius. reoe sacrorum‚] Markland
observes that the Claudii Pulcri or Nerones
had dropped the praenomen Lucius (Sueton.
Tib. c. 1), and that this L. Claudius must
therefore be a Marcellus, and a plebeian.
The other family was patrician. But the
‘ rex sacrorum ’ must bea patrician. ‘⁵ Sed
quid? si non ita sancte illa observata lex
fuit ? Quid ? si illa L ex C corrupta est ? '¹
(Gesner). “Quid denique? si haec ora-
tio ab homine indocto composita est?'’
(Wolf.)

pontifices minores,] lf we omit the rex
sacrorum, the three Pontifices minores, and
the two Flamines, there remaiu thirteen in
the Collegium, the number of which was in-
creased to fifteen by Sulla. Caesar was in
Gallia (De Domo, c. 1, note) ; and Pinarius
Natta (De Domo, c. 45) was nobody knows
where. It appears from this passage that

the Flamines sat and voted in the Collegium ,

Pontificum. The omission of the Flamen
Dialis is a notable fact, for the place was
then vacant (Tacit. Ann. iii. 58: ‘⁴ duobus
et septuaginta annis post Cornelii Merulae
caedem neminem suffectuni''). Augustus
elected a new Flamen, as Dion mentions
(54. c. 36). L. Cornelius Merula, who had
been elected consul in 13.c. 87 in Cinna's
place, was also Flamen Dialis. When Ma-
rius returned from exile, Merula committed
suicide to escape conviction on the charge
of having illegally had the consulship.
VVhether the omission of the Flamen Dialis
is to be ascribed to chance or to the writer's
learning, “deus aliquis scierit'' (Wolf).

Religionis explanatio vel ab uno pontifice perito

Klotz takes this to be evidence in favour of
the writer’s knowledge3 and it is. But
that does not prove that the writer is Cicero,
nor is it even any presumption in favour of
Cicero being the author of this speech.
The fact is true3 and that is all. Cicero’s
historical statements are not always true.

dztobus locis dicha] We know nothing
of these two hearings of the case, nor is
there any indication in the De Domo of its
being twice heard. Garatoni supposes that
the speech of Calidius about Cicero’s house
was delivered at the first hearing. Manu-
tius and others explain it thus. It was
first discussed in the Senate when Cicero’s
return was debated, then in the Forum
before the Pontifices when Cicero pleaded
his case. He refers to the passage in the
De Domo: “ut hos tales viros aliud de
summa hoc tempore religione sensuros ac
me absente senserint arbitrere.'⁷

7. tam frequens] It seems that they
were all there except two.—-¹ iidem potes-
tatem ι’ Baiter has ⁴ eidem potestatem!

ita est enim interpretatio] Wolf says:
“Minime ciceronianum est hoc ita, eo
modo positum, ut Pro Domo (e. 27).”
Klotz says the Latinity of the expression
scarcely requires proof, and ‘ita' is often
used in similar connexions.

explanatio] “Jam vide, quam parum
h. l. sibi constet Declamator, in rebus non
minus ludens quam in verbis. Antea tol-
lendae religioni duorum Pontificum respon-
suni ac verbum sufficiebat z dein tribus erat
opus3 jam vel per unum, scilicet peritum,
res fieri poterat '' (Wolf).
