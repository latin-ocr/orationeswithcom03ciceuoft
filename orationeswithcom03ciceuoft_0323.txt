CAP. 6, 7. 309

studere incipit et bellua immanis cum Graeculis philosophari, tum
est· Epicureus, non penitus illi disciplinae quaecumque est deditus,
sed captus uno verbo voluptatis. Habet autem magistros non
ex istis ineptis, qui dies totos de officio ac de virtute disserunt, qui
ad laborem, ad industriam, ad pericula pro patria subeunda adhor-
tantur, sed eos qui disputent horam nullam vacuam voluptate esse
debere, in omni parte corporis semper oportere aliquod gaudium
delectationemque versari. His utitur quasi praefectis libidinum
suarum, hi voluptates omnes vestigant atque odorantur; hi sunt
conditores instructoresque convivii: iidem expendunt atque aesti—
mant voluptates, sententiamque dicunt et judicant quantum cuique
libidini tribuendum esse videatur. Horum ille artibus eruditus ita
contempsit 113110 pudentissimam civitatem, ut omnes suas libidines,
omnia flagitia latere posse arbitraretur, si modo vultum importu-
num iu forum detulisset. VII. Is me, quamquam me quidem non
—cognoram 0111111 propter Pisonum affinitatem quam longe 1111110
abhoc genere cognatio materna Transalpini sanguinis abstulisset—
sed vos populumque Romanum non consilio, neque eloquentia, quod
in multis saepe accidit, sed rugis supercilioque decepit. L. Piso,

sense is certainly not concealed under these
words ’' (Klotz). I think there is.

bellua] There is a reading ‘ helluo.’ He
does not here declare himself altogether
against the* Epicureans, but 110 means to
say that Piso laid hold of the word ‘ plea-
sure ' and interpreted it his own way. The
¹ ex istis ineptis’ were the triflers, as Piso
supposed them to 110, 1110 grave philosophers
of the Stoa, who preached doctrines too
severe for him. All this passage seems to
110 taken from the P. Sestio, c. 10. At
least it is worth while to compare the two
passages; and particularly ⁴⁴ eos autem qui
dicerent dignitati esse serviendum, rei pub-
licae consulendum,‘’ &c.

pudentissimum] “ Ε.; prudentissimam, P.
G. S. et codd. plerique ’' (Halm). But thc
opposition between ‘pudor ⁷ contained in
‘ pudentissimam,' and ⁴ libido ’ shows what
the true reading is. Wolf has a note hero:
“Hoc audiens Senatus haud magis risum
tenuisset, opinor, quam intelligens quisque
nunc Londini teneret aut Parisiis si quis in
publica oratione has urbes pudentissimum
diceret.’'

7. propter Pisonum] Cicero's daughter
Tullia was married 10 C. Calpurnius Piso,
which affinity had given Cicero the oppor-
tunity of knowing more about the consul
Piso. The sentence is very confused, and
the expression ‘ab hoc genere . . . abstu-

lisset ³ is vag-ue.

L. Piso . . . pestis meae.‹⁹] One purpose
for which we read the best Greek and Ro-
man writers is to improve our judgment
and our taste. Markland says of this pas-
sage: ‘⁴ Satis est talia legisse hominem li-
bero judicio et animo Ciceronianis litteris
innutrito, ut intelligat hanc eloquentiam
pueriliter ludentis ingenii esse, non Cice-
ronis.'' Markland refers to the passages in
Cicero 111 which he makes reflections on
Piso’s person (Pro Sestio, c. 8; In Pisonem,
0. 6, 9). Gesner, who wrote in defence
of the genuineness of this and the other
speeches in reply to Markland, thinks that
all this is in Cicero's style, and wonders
that Markland should have found fault with
it, when he produces from the undoubted
orations of Cicero other examples of the
531110 3111150 of Piso. But Wolf has his
answer for Gesner. Antitheses are common
in good orators, but such antitheses as
these! Unluckily Piso was now in Mace-
donia, and the point, if there is any, would
1050 115 effect for want of an object. A
render of good sense would conclude from
the words that Piso was in the Senate3
and his conclusion would be just. That is
enough 10 condemn the passage. So in the
oration to the Pontifices hc often addresses
Clodius, who, if he was present, must have
come purposcly to hear himself abused.
