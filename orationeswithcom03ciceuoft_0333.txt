CAP. 11, 12.

319

universum populum salutem populi Romani et conservatam per me
et conjunctam esse cum mea dixerit ς qui caussam meam prudentibus
commendarit, imperitos edocuerit, eodemque tempore improbos
auctoritate sua compresserit, bonos excitarit, qui populum Roma-
num pro me tamquam pro fratre aut pro parente non solum hortatus
sit, verum etiam obsecrarit; qui quum ipse propter metum dimica—
tionis et sanguinis domo se teneret, jam a superioribus tribunis
petierit ut de salute mea et promulgarent et referrent3 qui in
colonia nuper constituta, quum ipse gereret magistratum, in qua
nemo erat emptus intercessor, vim et crudelitatem privilegii aucto-
ritate honestissimorum hominum et publicis litteris consignarit,
princepsque Italiae totius praesidium ad meam salutem implorandum
putarit; qui quum ipse mihi semper amicissimus fuisset, etiam ut

suos necessarios mihi amicos redderet elaborarit.

jam α superioribus] “Jam P.; etiam
codd. rell. et edd. (tenere etiam S.),⁷’ Halm.
But ‘tenere etiam ’ may be read ‘teneret
jam.’ The tribunes are those of the year
before. These who have leisure may count
how often in these four spurious orations
the story is told of Pompeius shutting him-
self up at home (domo se teneret) ; rather
oftener than the great man would like to
hear.

colonia] The ‘ colonia ' was Capua, where
Caesar had established a ‘colonia' 111 1115
consulship (15.6. 59). Cn. Pompeius was
Duumvir in Capua with L. Piso, and had
got a decree passed in favourable terms to
Cicero (In Pisonem, 6. 11 3 Pro Milone, 6.
15). At Capua there was no bribed in-
tercessor, 110 111311 bought like a Roman
Tribune to interpose his ‘intercessio.' He
alludes to Aelius Ligur tr. pl., who being
bought by Clodius interposed his veto when
L. Ninnius on the kalends of June proposed
the recall of Cicero (Pro Sestio, c. 31).

privileyz'i] He calls it a Privilegium, the
Lex of Clodius by which he was banished.
A Privilegium is a Lex made for a particu-
lar case. Gellius (x. 20) after giving Ateius
Capito’s definition of a Lex, “Lex est
generale jussum populi aut plebis rogante
magistratu‚'⁷ says, “Ea definitio si probe
facta est, neque (16 imperio Cn. Pompeii,
neque de reditu M. Ciceronis, neque de
caede P. Clodii quaestio, neque alia id genus
populi plebisve jussa, loyes vocari possunt,
non sunt 6111111 generalia jussa, neque de
universis civibus3 sed de singulis concepta;
quocirca privilegia potius vocari debent,
quia veteres priva dixerunt quae nos singula
dici1nus.’' It is said in the oration De

XII. Quibus

Domo, c. 17 : “ vetant leges saeratae, vetant
xri tabulae, leges privatis hominibus irrogari ;
id est enim privilegium.⁷⁷ There are also
the passages in the De Legibus, iii. 6. 4,
19 3 and in the Pro Sestio, 6. 30. Τ116 passage
in the De Legibus, iii. 19, 15 clear: “Et
nondum natis seditiosis tribunis plebis, ne
cogitatis quidem, admirandum tantum ma-
jores in posterum providisse: in privatos
homines leges ferri noluerunt ; id est enim
privilegium, quo quid est injustius? quum
legis 11366 vis sit [ut sit] scitum et jussum
in omnes. Ferri de singulis nisi centuriatis
comitiis noluerunt.''

But the Romans had other meanings of
Privilegium, which was what they called
Jus Singulare as opposed to Jus Commune.
“Thus we have Privilegia of soldiers in
making testaments (Dig. 28. 6. 15), the
Privilegia of several classes of persons as
excuses from ‘tutela,’ and very frequently
Privilegia in favour of creditors ‘in con-
cursu,’ especially the Fiscus, persons under
age, &c.⁷’ (Savigny, System, i. 62).

auctoritate . . . publicis litteris] The
‘decretum' of Capua declared the Lex by
which Cicero was banished to be a Privile-
gium. It was marked as a Privilegium by
the authority of most honourable men and
the public documents. Hotuiann thought
the passage obscure, and Wolf sneers at the
‘rara formula! Klotz explains it correctly,
and says that the orator has similar forins
of expression 111 a hundred other plaees3 and
adds : ‘⁸ let this be observed rather for those
who would not understand the passage, than
for those who really did not understand
it.’'
