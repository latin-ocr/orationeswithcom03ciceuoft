530 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO
nefariis pestibus in deorum hominumque conspectu esset occi-
sus sanctissimo in templo, sanctissima in caussa, sanctissimo in
magistratu. Ejus igitur vitam quisquam spoliandam ornamentis
esse dicet, cujus mortem ornandam monumento sempiterno puta-
retis?

XXXIX. Homines, inquit, emisti, coegisti, parasti.—-—Quid
uti faceret? senatum obsideret? cives indemnatos expelleret? bona
diriperet? aedes incenderet? tecta disturbaret? templa deorum
immortalium inflammaret? tribunos plebis ferro e rostris expel-
leret? provincias quas-vellet quibus vellet venderet? reges appel-
laret-3 rerum capitalium condemnatos in liberas civitates per
legatos nostros reduceret? principem civitatis ferro obsessum
teneret? Haec ut efficere posset, quae fieri nisi armis oppressa
re publica nullo modo poterant, idcirco, credo, manum sibi P. Ses-

tius et copias comparavit.—At nondum erat maturum; nondum ‘

res ipsa ad ejusmodi praesidia viros bonos compellebat—Pulsi nos
eramus, non omnino ista manu sola, sed tamen non sine ista:
vos taciti maerebatis. Captum erat forum anno superiore, aede
Castoris tamquam arce aliqua a fugitivis occupata: silebatur.
Omnia hominum quum egestate tum audacia perditorum clamore,
concursu, vi, manu gerebantur: perferebatiS. Magistratus templis
pellebantur, alii omnino aditu ac foro prohibebantur: nemo resis-
tebat. Gladiatores ex praetoris comitatu comprehensi, in sena·

39. Homines . . . coeyisti‚] This was the
charge against Sestius (Manutius). To get
men together in order to accomplish any
thing by violence is treason, if the violence
is directed against the sovereign power;
and it is riot, or whatever else is the proper
name, if it is directed against a private per-
son, or more than one. This second kind
of violence the Romans called Vis, and the
penalties of the Lex Plautia were directed
against it.

senatum obsideret ἒ] An allusion, as it
seems, to the story told in Plutarch (Cicero,
c. 31), who says: “When the Senate had
met in order to pass a vote that the people
should change their dress as in a public cala-
mity, and the consuls (Gabinius and Piso)
opposed it, and Clodius was in arms about
the Senate-house, no small number of the
Senators ran out tearing their clothes and
calling aloud.” The rest of the allusions
will be understood if a man will read the
oration carefully. Clodius burnt a temple
of the Nymphae (Pro Milone, c. 273 Pro
Caelio, c. 32).

At nondum erat maturum .·] These words

refer to what Cicero does not deny, that
Sestius did get a body of armed men to-
gether; and to what he does deny, that he
got them together for the same purposes
that Clodius did; but he collected them in
order to defend the state when the time came.
anno superiora] In n.c. 58, the year of
Clodius’ tribuneship, when Castor’s temple,
the ‘castellum’ of the great tribune, was
occupied by him (c. l5; De Domo, c. 21).
ea· praetoris comitatu] App. Claudius
Pulcher, P. Clodius' brother.-—-‘ alterius tri-
buniz’ Milo, whose house was attacked by
Clodius. Cicero tells the story in a letter
to Atticus (iv. 3), as Manutius says, and he
adds that on this ground Milo prosecuted
him De Vi. But the letter tells us plainly
that this attack on Milo's house was made
after Cicero’s return. In the Quum Se-
natui, c. 8, mention is made of Milo attempt-
ing to prosecute Clodius De Vi, but the
Declamator does not mention the attack of
Clodius on Milo’s house; and he is con-
sistent in not doing so, for the attack was
made pridie Id. Nov. (Ad Att. iv. 3), after
the day on which the oration Quum Senatui
