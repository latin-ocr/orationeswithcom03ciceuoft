482 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

Ac posteaquam est intellectum, M. Catone tribuno pl. fortissimo
atque optimo civi rem publicam defendente, per se ipsum senatum
populumque Romanum sine militum praesidio tueri facile majes-
tatem suam dignitatemque eorum, qui salutem communem peri-
culo suo defendissent, Sestius cum illo exercitu summa celeritate
est Antonium consecutus. Hic ego quid praedicem, quibus hic
rebus consulem ad rem gerendam excitarit? quos stimulos admove-
rit homini studioso fortasse victoriae, sed tamen nimium com-
munem Martem belli casumque metuenti? Longum est ea dicere,
sed hoc breve dicam: si M. Petreii non excellens animus et amor
rei publicae, non praestans in re publica virtus, non summa aucto-
ritas apud milites, non mirificus usus in re militari exstitisset,
neque adjutor ei P. Sestius ad excitandum Antonium, cohortan-
dum, accusandum, impellendum fuisset, datus illo in bello esset
hiemi locus, neque umquam Catilina, quum e pruina Apennini
atque e nivibus illis emersisset atque aestatem integrali] nactus
Italiae calles et pastorum stabula praedari coepisset, sine multo

Antonium] Antonius had the com-
mand of the troops which were sent against

fourteen or fifteen years later. The Petreius
who was beaten in Spain still continued

Catilina in Etruria (Introd. to the orations
against Catilina). Petreius was his legatus,
and he fought the battle with the rebels.

communem Martem belli] ⁴ Mars belli ’
is an expression which Cicero (De Or. iii.
42) compares with ⁴ Ceres ' used for ⁴ fruges,'
and ⁴ Liber ' for ⁴ vinum.’ The reading used
to be ⁴ communem Martem bellique casum.y
Madvig says that the Romans always said
⁴ communis Mars belli,⁷ as in Livy v. 12:
⁴⁴ nequidquam Sergio Martem communem
belli fortunamque accusante.'' Halm re-
marks that in the passage in the Pro Milone,
c. 21, and Phil. x. c. 10, and Livy 42. e. 14,
or in the first two at least, the genitive may
refer to ⁴ Martem communem.r It is plain
however that it does not in the example
from Livy: “Martem communem esse et
incertum eventum belli.’⁷

breve] ‘breve ' P.‚ ⁴ brevi ’ G. ⁴⁴ It
would be tedious to tell all that; but this
which is short Ι will tell.”

mirificus usus] ⁴⁴ Homo militaris, quod
amplius annos triginta tribunus aut praefec-
tus aut legatus aut praetor cum magna
gloria fuerat” (Sallust, Cat. c. 59). Dru-
mann (v. p. 566), cited by Halm, concludes
from this remark about the number of years
which Petreius had served, that he cannot
be Pompeius’ legatus Petreius whom Caesar
afterwards defeated in Spain, B.c. 49. A
man who in 13.c. 62 had served thirty
years might possibly be still in command

to fight against Caesar, and he was in the
battle of Thapsus, B.c. 46 (Bell. Afric. c.
18, &c.). After the defeat by Caesar, Juba
and Petreius agreed to sight in order to kill
one another, and Juba easily killed Petreius,
who was the weaker3 whether from age or
otherwise the writer of the African war
does not say (c. 94 ).—⁴ accusandum ε’ ⁴ re-
prove.’ Halm compares ce. 57, 63.—
⁴hiemi locusz’ the war would have been
protracted through the winter.

nactus] ⁴ nanctus,’ 1³¹. G1. Wesenberg
derives it from ⁴ nancio' (Forcellini‚ Lex.).
as ⁴ sanctus‚' he says, comes from ‘ sancio.'
Schneider (Caesar, B. G. iv. 36) 1135 3 note
in which he proves that the form ⁴ nanctus '
often occurs in the MSS.‚ and the remark
of Priscian shows that both forms were
used: ⁴⁴ Nanciscor etiam nactum facit abs-
que n, ut Probo et Capro et Pollioni
et Plinio placet” (Mai, De Re Publica, i.

galles] See Pro Cluentio, c. 59. Gara-
toni refers to Livy 22. 0. 14: “Nos hic
pecorum modo per aestivos saltus deviosque
calles exercitum ducimus conditi nubibus
silvisque.'’—⁴ stabula :’ Halm (l) has ⁴ sta-
bula praeclara cepisset,' the reading, he says,
of the best MSS.‚ except that some of them
have ⁴ coepisset,' which is a common mis-
take. The critics not liking ⁴ stabula prae-
clara cepisset,’ began to take the reading of
the inferior MSS.‚ ⁴ stabula praedari coepis-
