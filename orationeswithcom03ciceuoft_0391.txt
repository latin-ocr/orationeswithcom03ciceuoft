CAP. 17, 18. 377

conversionem stat-us et inclinationem communium temporum, quid
tandem futurum est iis, quorum vita remota ab honore populari et
ab hac illustri gratia est, pecuniae autem tantae sunt, ut eas
nimium multi, egentes, sumptuosi, nobiles concupiscant? Date
hanc tribuno plebis licentiam, et intuemini paullisper animis juven-
tutem, et eos maxime qui imminere jam cupiditate videntur in
tribuniciam potestatem: collegia, medius fidius, tribunorum plebis
tota reperientur hoc jure firmato, quae coeant de hominum locuple-
tissimorum bonis, praeda praesertim populari et spe largitionis
oblata. ’

nefarium, ne in sceleratissimo quidem civi sine judicio ferundum.
Non tulit ut interdicatur. Quid ergo? UT INTERDICTUM s1T.
Ο caenum, o portentum, o scelus! Hanc tibi legem Clodius
scripsit spurciorem lingua sua, ut interdictum sit cui non sit
interdictum? Sexte noster, bona venia, quoniam jam dialecticus
es et haec quoque liguris, quod factum non est, ut sit factum,
ferri ad populum aut verbis ullis sanciri aut suffragiis confirmari
potest? Hoc tu scriptore, hoc consiliario, hoc ministro, omnium
non bipedum solum, sed etiam quadrupedum impurissimo, rem
publicam perdidisti? neque tu eras tam excors tamque demens ut
nescires Clodium esse qui contra leges faceret, alios qui leges
scribere solerent3 sed neque eorum neque ceterorum, in quibus

the change of condition and the downward
course of the commonwealth.'' Ι suppose
the change of condition to be his own
change of condition.

et iyni] There is a reading ‘ et ignis,' but
the ablative is the regular construction.

ut interdictum sit] Was this so written
in the Lex, or did the Declamator invent it
to found an argument on it? Markland
supposes that ‘interdictum sit' might be
said as well as ‘ interdicatur! The fact is,
that the infinitive present is the common
form in a ‘rogatio.’ When the subjunctive
is used, as in the formula of ‘adrogatio'
(Gellius, v. 19), it is in the present: ‘⁶ Ve-
litis, jubeatis Quirites ut Lucius Valerius
Lucio Titio tam jure lege q. (sibi) filius
siet quam si,” &c.; where a past tense
would not do. If the ‘ rogatio ' of Clodius
was expressed in the form ‘interdictum sit,'
that did not affect its validity, and all this
talk about it has no purpose. Cicero never
makes this objection to the Lex of Clodius
when he is speaking about it. Are we to

suppose that Clodius and his partizans could
not follow the usual formula, whatever it
was ?

jam dialecticus es] ‘ Es ’ is wanting in
some MSS.; perhaps in all. The Decla-
mator is witty: he calls him ⁴ Dialecticus ;'
but I do not see the point of his wit.
Cicero's definition of ⁴ dialectica’ is “ars
bene disserendi et vera ac falsa dijudicandi’'
(De Or. ii. 38; and Top. 0. 2; Brutus, c.
41, 42, speaking of Servius) z an art to
which the Declamator is quite a stranger.

liyurz's,] Manutius has explained what
Hotmann did not understand. All that fol-
lows is miserable. The opposition between
the Clodius who acted against the laws, and
others who are employed to draw up the
laws, is exactly after this writer’s fashion.
—‘ operum architectis ι’ architects of what?
Of the temple of Libertas, says Manutius,
which was built on the site (area) of Cicero’s
house on the Palatine. The allusion to the
Pontifex is explained by c. -51,
