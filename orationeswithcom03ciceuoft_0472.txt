458 ORAT. DE HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS
provinciae se ac rei militari dedit, atque ibi piratarum contumelias
perpessus etiam Cilicum libidines barbarorumque satiavit; post
exercitu L. Luculli sollicitato per nefandum scelus fugit illinc,
Romaeque recenti adventu suo cum propinquis suis decidit, ne reos
faceret3 a Catilina pecuniam accepit, ut turpissime praevaricaretur.
Inde cum Murena se in Galliam contulit, in qua provincia mor-
tuorum testamenta conscripsit, pupillos necavit, nefarias cum multis
scelerum pactiones societatesque conflavit. Unde ut rediit, quaes-
tum illum maxime fecundum uberemque campestrem totum ad se
ita redegit, ut homo popularis fraudaret improbissime populum,
idemque vir clemens divisores omnium tribuum domi ipse suae
crudelissima morte mactaret. Exorta est illa rei publicae, sacris,
religionibus, auctoritati vestrae, judiciis publicis funesta quaestura;
in qua idem iste deos hominesque, pudorem, pudicitiam, senatus
auctoritatem, jus, fas, leges, judicia violavit. Atque hic ei gradus,
o misera tempora stultasque nostras discordias, P. Clodio gradus
ad rem publicam hic primus est- aditus ad popularem jactationem
atque ascensus. Nam Ti. Graccho invidia Numantini foederis, cui

says, to mean “jus et vinculum fratrum seu
germanorum.’'

L. Luculli] The story of Clodius excit-
ing mutiny in Lucullus' army is told by
Plutarch (Lucullus, c. 34) and by Dion
Cassius, 35. c. 14, who however, as Wolf
remarks, “ Clodium a piratis captum narrat
aule istam exercitus Luculliani solicita-
tionem.” So it is said here also. But Wolf
intended to write ‘ post,’ for Dion (35. c. 17)
places Clodius' capture by the pirates after he
had left Lucullus.—‘ illinc ι’ ι1111111,γ Baiter.

Catilina] Whom Clodius accused of
‘repetundae‚¹ B.c. 65, and then acted the
⁴ praevaricator' (In Pison. c. 10; Introd. to
the orations against Catilina).

cum Murena] 13.c. (5⁴. See Pro Murena,
c. 26. Drumann remarks that if Clodius
did all that he is here charged with Murena
did not deserve Cicero’s panegyric, for he
ought to have stopped Clodius. “Cicero
exaggeratos every way :'’ or the Declamator.

campestrem] He alludes to bribery in
the Campus, but I do not pretend to know
exactly what he means to say. Klotz ad-
mits there is exaggeration in this long list
of crimes, but he contends that this does
not prove that Cicero is not the author3
which Ι grant. But ‘ divisores omnium
tribuum . . . mactaret’ is rather more than
even Cicero would say in his most extrava-
gant mood: “ At divisores omnium tribuum
a Clodio occisos Judaeus credat Apella, non

quisquam Christianorum ” (Wolf).

Atque liic ei yradns,] ‘⁶ Absurda struc-
tura verborum, neque cetera illa placent,
lzic primus est· aditus—adscensus. Neque
omittenda saltem est elegans correctio Lam-
bini, yraclus ad rempubl. hic primusszcit,
hic primus adilns '’ (Wolf).

Ti. Graccho] We had the Gracchi in c.
19, and they appear again. This is the
Declamator’s fashion. His actors are worked
hard. In c. 19 he told us that Ti. Gracchus
‘a senatu desciverat! Here the ‘invidia
Numantini foederis . . . a gravitate patrum
desciscere coegit.’ He has first told it us in
general terms. Now he comes to the par-
ticulars. The story of the consul C. Man-
cinus, 13.c. 137, and his treaty with the
Numantini is told by Plutarch (Ti. Grac-
chus, c. 5). The senate did not recognize
Mancinus' treaty, and the Romans gave him
up to the Numantines, but the Numantini
would not accept him (Cic. De Off. iii. 30).
It is not true that the Numantine treaty
was the cause of Gracchus ‘ deserting the
gravity of the Senate;' for ‘patrum’ does
not mean the ⁴ patres’ of Gracchus, as some
have supposed. The passage in Cicero which
comes nearest to the assei-tion made here is
in the Brutus (c. 27). But compare Pro
Sestio, c. 48. It was the Agraria Lex of
Gracchus which disturbed the state. He
had nothing to complain of in the matter of
Mancinus.
