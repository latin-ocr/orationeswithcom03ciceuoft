served, use no more abbreviations than
those which were in common use: or if
they did write it down in short-hand, it
might be transcribed into full-hand.

C. Cosconizcm,] He was Governor of
Hispania Ulterior after his praetorship with
the title of Proconsul (In Vatin. c. 5).

M. Messallam] He was then a candi-
date for the Praetorship, as Cicero says. a
candidate at the time when the evidence
was taken against the conspirators, at which
time the electioris for B.c. 62 were over.
If he had been praetor designatus when
Cicero was delivering this oration, he would
have said so. He was perhaps not praetor
till Bc. 61. Halm concludes that this
is not the Messalla mentioned in c. (i,
who was present when Cicero was deliver-
ing this speech, and who was praetor in
Rc. 63, as it is stated in modern books, but
I do not know the evidence for this. As he
was consul in B.c. 61, this makes an inter-
val of one year only between his praetor-
ship and consulship. He purchased the
house of Autronius when it was sold (Cic.
Ad Att i. 13). The Messalla mentioned
in this chapter was consul in B.c. 53. It
does not appear who was his father3 and we
have no evidence that he was the son of
Niger (c. 6), as it is sometimes said. It is
not likely that the father was consul 13.c.
61, and the son in B.c. 53; for Niger was
still a young man in ss.c. 80, when Cicero
was defending Sex. Roscius: “qui si jam
satis aetatis atque roboris haberet, ipse pro
Sex. Roscio diceret„ (Pro Sex. Roscio,
c. 51).

P. Niyidium,] He was Figulus, a
learned man and an intimate friend of
Cicero. He was an opponent of Caesar,
and died in B.c. 44 in exile. There is a
letter of Cicero to Nigidius (Ad Div. iv.
13); and a passage in Gellius (xix. 14)
about him.

Appius Claudius was the elder brother of
Cicero’s enemy P. Clodius. He was con-
sul in u.c. 54, and Cicero succeeded him as
Proconsul in the government os Cilicia.

There are several letters of Cicero to Ap-
pius, worth reading if a man wishes to
understand Cicero’s character (Ad Fam.
Lib. iii. .

15. iia. . .ut . . . tamen] ‘ In the limited
sense‚' says Halm, sor ‘ quidem. . . sed.’
He understands the meaning, but we gain
nothing by supposing one thing to be said
for another. He refers to other instances
of ⁴ita. . .ut' in c. 20, 21. 26. Ι have
made several remarks on ‘ ita . . . ut,’ which
are often used to affirm a thing on one side,
and yet to oppose something to it on the
other side.

privata . . . custodia] It appears that the
acta of the Senatus, except the Senatus
consulta, were kept by the consuls during
their consulship, a practice that might have
led to great abuses. Cicero speaks of this
practice again in the oration Pro Archia,
c. 5. It is difficult to suppose that a consul
after the term of his office had expired,
could have kept such records as the evidence
of the conspiracy. Becker (Handbuch,
Vol. I. 32, note) says, “if we were to as-
sume that these records were given up to
the Aerarium or Tabularium when the ma-
gistrate retii-ed from his office, and not
before, Cicero’s words (Pro Sulla, c. 15)
would have no just meaning; for it was
during the last days of the year when this
publication was made, and consequently‚
independently of this, the Tabulae would
have been immediately withdrawn from
‘privata custodia' on the termination of the
term of office.'’ There is nothing in this
remark. If the records passed from the
consul's hands into the Archives, he could
not have published them after he had given
them up, and perhaps nobody else would
have done it.

The ⁴ omnes librarii ' were, as Halm sup-
poses, the ¹ scribac publici.' Neai· the end
of the chapter he speaks of ⁴ scribac mei.'
Sometimes the expression ⁴ scriba librarius’
occurs· There is a note on Scribac (In Cat.
iv, c. 7).—⁴statim describi,’ Halm.
