tulerit. Qui excitatus quum summa auctoritate P. Servilii, tum incre-
dibili quadam gravitate dicendi, quum ille omnes prope ab inferis
evocasset Metellos, et ad illius generis quod sibi cum eo commune
esset· dignitatem propinqui sui mentem a Clodianis latrociniis re-
flexisset, quumque eum ad domestici exempli memoriam et ad
Numidici illius Metelli casum vel gloriosum vel gravem conver-
tisset, collacrimavit vir egregius ac vere Metellus totumque se
P. Servilio dicenti etiam tum tradidit, nec illam divinam gravitatem .
plenam antiquitatis diutius homo ejusdem sanguinis potuit sus-
tinere et mecum absens beneficio suo rediit in gratiam. Quod
certe, si est aliqui sensus in morte praeclarorum virorum, quum
omnibus Metellis, tum vero uni viro fortissimo et praestantissimo
civi gratissimum fratri suo fecit, socio laborum, periculorum, con-
siliorum meorum.

LXIII. Reditus vero meus qui fuerit quis ignorat? quemadmodum
mihi advenienti tamquam totius Italiae atque ipsius patriae dextram
porrexerint Brundisini, quum ipsis Nonis Sextilibus idem dies ad-
ventus mei fuisset reditusque, natalis idem carissimae filiae, quam

quum summa auctoritate . . . tum incredi-
bili] The emendation of Manutius, which
Halm (2) has accepted, though in (l) he
preferred something else.

P. Servilii‚] Quum Senatui, c. 10, note.

ab inferis] Compare the passage in the
Quum Senatui, c. 10, and the note: com-
pare the original and the parody.

collat-rimavit] “Apte‘' says Halm,“con-
tulit Abrami proverbium Graecum: α’γιι-
&oi δ’ α’ριόιίκρυες (ἶνόρες.” So in c. 55 we
have “lacrimantes gandio,” and in c. 56,
‘⁶ flens et recenti laetitia et mixto dolore‚'’
where the same diligent Abrami compares
Aeschylus, Agam. v. 261 ε χαρὰ μ’ ὑφέρπει
δάκρυον ἐκκαλουμένη. But Halm quotes
something from Drumann (v. p. 679) which
is more apt : “ The tears of Metellus were
soon dried3 and it was not the speech of
Servilius, but regard to Pompeius, who now
was in favour of Cicero’s return, which de-
termined him to suppress his hatred for the
moment.”

plenam antiquitatis] ‘Full of old Ro-
man honesty ;' compare c. 3: “duobus his
gravissimae antiquitatis viris'’ (Halm);
who explained it, I suppose, because Manu-
tius erroneously thought that it was an al-
lusion to the old age of Servilius; which is
a singular mistake. But all men make mis-
takes, except the infallible few.

beneficio suo] See De Prov. Cons. c. 9.
The ‘beneficium' was his joining his col-

league Lentulus in making the motion to
the Senate about Cicero's recall (Manutius).
Halm observes that Manutius proposed to
add ‘ su0,’ and we have now the evidence
of A. sor putting it in the text.

in morte] ⁴ In the state ot death.’ Abi-ami
compares an expression of Sulpicius in a
letter to Cicero (Ad Fam. iv. 5) : “ Si quis
etiam inferis sensus est ;” and other like ex-
pressions of hope or doubt about the dead
being conscious of what happens among the
living. Such collecting of passages may seem
a trivial labour; and it is in one way, In
another way there is something in it. The
human race is one in its organization and
its appetites3 one also in its desires, its
hopes, and its feam. It does not change,
and is neither better nor worse in its natu-
ral capacities than it was in the remotest
period to which we can trace its habits and
opinions.

fratri suo . . . socio] Q. Metellus Celer,
now dead (Quum Senatui, c. 10, and the
note). The Schol. says of Celer: “qui
proximo triennio decesserat, infami etiam
morte de veneficio, quod ei paratum vel
apud Clodium fratrem vel apud uxorem
Clodiam videbatur.''

63. Reditus . . . meus] In two other
places Cicero describes his return : Ad Att.
iv. l ; In Pison. c. ‘32 (Halm).

reditusque, natalis idem] The reading
of some of the MSS. is ‘reditus qui natalis
