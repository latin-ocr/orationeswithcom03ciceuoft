5161111611 from the ranks of the army into the Senate3 and others who
had become rich enough to live in regal state. Every man who had
nothing to lose might hope for a glorious prize in the midst of the
general confusion. The men who had got their living in the country by
hard labour flocked to Rome, where they lived 011 1116 bounty of indivi-
duals and the allowance made to the poor by the State3 they preferred>
this idle life in the city to the 111-1111111 labour of the fields. It was no
wonder if such men, who were beggars and had no principle, knew not
their own true interests, still less what was best for the State. There
were men too whose fathers had perished in Sulla's proscriptions, who
had lost their property, and even some of the rights of citizens. Such
men had nothing more to lose. Lastly, all the men who were not of the
Senatorial party wished for revolution, for any change rather than their
present inferior condition. Some years had now passed since the trou-
blesome tim es of the last civil war and Sulla's tyranny, and the old state
of things had come round again.

The tribunitian authority was restored in the consulship of Cn. Pom-
peius and M. Crassus; and many young men who were elected to this
office, presumptuous and inexperieneed, stirred up the Plebs against the
Senate3 they bribed them and made them promises; they sought only
power and influence. The Nobility opposed the Tribuni; but under
the pretext of niaintaining the authority of the Senate they were only
seeking their own interest. To 511111 up in a few wordS‚ all the agitators
of the time, though they covered their designs under specious words,
and pretended that their object was the public good, 10011611 only to
their own interest, some pretending to defend the liberties of the 11601116,
others the authority of the Senate. There was no moderatim, no 11111115
10 1116 furious passions of either party. Both sides used a victory with
equal cruclty.

After the appointment of Cn. Pompeius to the command in the war
against the 11110165, 1116 power of the Plebs was weakened and the influ-
ence of the few increased. The high offices of the state, the provinces,
and every thing else, were in the hands of these ferr. They lived in
wealth and security3 and they terrified their opponents by threatening
them with prosecutionS, and so they hoped to make 1116111 1655 active 111
stirring up 1110 Plebs. But when the hope of change was presented to
the 116111161- party, the old dispute between them and the Nobility was
revivcd. If Catilina 111 1110 first battle had come off victorious, or even
without defeat, great rnin and calamity would have fallen 011 1110 State3
nor would the victorious party have been able to enjoy their success
long before 501116 strengel· power wrestcd fron] their exhausted and
lifeless hands both 1116 governnient and liberty. These are the opinions
