ORAT. I. IN L. CATILINAM CAP. 1, 2. 17
convocaveris, quid consilii ceperiS, quem nostrum ignorare arbi-
traris? O tempora! o mores! senatus haec intelligit; consul
videt: hic tamen vivit. Vivit? immo vero etiam in senatum venit;
fit publici consilii particeps; notat et designat oculis ad caedem
unum quemque nostrum. Nos autem, fortes viri, satisfacere rei
publicae videmur, si istius furorem ac tela vitemus. Ad mortem
te, Catilina, duci jussu consulis jampridem oportebat; in te con-
ferri pestem quam tu in nos omnes [jamdiu] machinaris. An vero
vir amplissimus, P. Scipio, pontifex maximus, Ti. Gracchum me-
diocriter labefactantem statum rei publicae privatus interfecit;
Catilinam orbem terrae caede atque incendiis vastare cupientem
nos consules perferemus? Nam illa nimis antiqua praetereo, quod
C. Servilius Ahala Sp. Maelium novis rebus studentem manu sua
occidit. Fuit, fuit ista quondam in hac re publica virtus, ut viri
fortes acrioribus suppliciis civem perniciosum quam acerbissimum

ΙΙ. Decrevit quondam senatus, ut L. Opimius consul vider-et ne
quid res publica detrimenti caperet. Nox nulla intercessit : inter-

fectus est propter quasdam seditionum suspiciones C. Gracchus,

at Laeca’s and the first oration. Sallust
(Cat. c. 27) mentions the meeting at Laeca’s

frorn Livy, whose narrative is more probable.
If Maelius was rightly summoned, and re-

house.

P. Scipio,] This was P. Scipio Nasica
Serapio, Pontifex Maximus, who led the
rout that attacked Ti. Gracchus and killed
him (B.c. 133). The head of religion, a
man who held no ‘magistratus’ (privatus),
led senators and a rabble with clubs and
sticks to assault Gracchus (Plutarch, Ti.
Gracchus, c. 19). But Scipio was soon
obliged to leave Rome 111 consequence of
this scandalous riot, and 110 died abroad. If
we had to trust Cicero only for our know-
ledge of Roman history, we should be much
deceived. In another place (De Am. c. 12)
110 represents Ti. Gracchus as attempting to
seize royal power; and he adds, ‘vel reg-
navit is quidem paucos menses! In the
next chapter he says that C. Gracchus was
put to death ⁴ propter quasdam seditionum
suspiciones.’ 110 speaks of the Gracchi in
the orations against Rullus (ii. 5. Vol. IL).

Servilius Ahala] The story is in Livy
, (iv. 1-1). Ahala killed Maelius when he
would not obey the sunnnons of the dic-
tator Cincinnatus; and the dictator ap-
proved of the act. Cicero (De Senect. c. 16)
tells the story incorrectly; at least he differs

VOL. 111.

fused to obey the master of the horse, Ahala,
who was appointed to take him, Ahala was
justified in using force for the purpose ; and
if Maelius resisted‚ he was justified in killing
him. If this were not so, there would be no
authority in a state. Niebuhr has misstated
this matter 111 his Roman history.

senatus consultum] This alludes to the
‘senatus consultum’ of the twenty-first of
October, by which the consuls received au-
thority to employ force of arms: “darent
operam consules ne quid res publica detri-
menti caperet.” See the Introduction ; and
Sallust, Cat. c. 29.

2. L. Opimius] The story of C. Grac-
cbus’ death is in Plutarch (C. Gracchus,
c. 14, &c). Plutarch speaks of one son of
M. Fulvius Flaccus being massacred in this
disturbance and another after. (See 11010, 111
Cat. iv¹ (ἱ.) Velleius Pater-culus (ii. (i) has
also told tho story of the death ot' C. (irac-
chus and his partizanS. The father of the
two Gracchi was Ti. Sempronius (iram-hus,
who had been twice consul, and censor
(13.c. 1⁴59). Their mother was Ummidia, the
daughter of Scipio, the conqueror of llan-
nibal‚ P. Scipio Africanus major.
