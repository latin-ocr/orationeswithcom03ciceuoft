futuros? Non vident id se cupere, quod si adepti sint, fugitivo
alicui aut gladiatori concedi sit necesse? Tertium genus est aetate
jam affectum, sed tamen exercitatione robustum, quo ex genere
est ipse Manlius cni nunc Catilina succedit. Sunt homines exiis
coloniis quas Sulla constituit, quas ego universas civium esse opti-
morum et fortissimorum virorum sentio 3 sed tamen ii sunt coloni,
qui se in insperatis repentinisque pecuniis sumptuosius insolentius-
que jactarunt.» Hi dum aedificant tamquam beati, dum praediis,
lecticis, familiis magnis, conviviis apparatis delectantur, in tantum
aes alienum inciderunt, ut, si salvi esse velint, Sulla sit his ab
inferis excitandus3 qui etiam nonnullos agrestes homines tenues
atque egentes in eandem illam spem rapinarum veterum impu-
lerunt. Quos ego utrosque, Quirites, in eodem genere praeda-
torum direptorumque pono; sed eos hoc moneo: desinant furere
ac proscriptiones et dictaturas cogitare. Tantus enim illorum
temporum dolor inustus est civitati, ut jam ista non modo homines
sed 110 pecudes quidem mihi passurae esse videantur. X. Quartum
genus est sane varium et mixtum et turbulentum qui jam pridem

sit necesse ?] Halm has a good note 011 farms, their luxurious litters, many slaves

this remark of Cicero, which 110 paraphrases
thus: “ 11 is inevitable according to the
principle established by experience, that 1110
revolution devours its own children, and the
first leaders of a revolutionary movement
never maintain themselves in possession of
the power which they expected.'’

Tertium yeuus] This passage gives 115
some insight into the state of Italy at this
time. Sulla planted his soldiers in various
parts of Italy to the number of 0110 hundred
and twenty thousand, as Appian says (B. C.
i. 104), and chiefly in Etruria; for the
Etrurians and the Samnites made the long—
est resistance of all those who supported
Marius’ party. Manlius (Dion Cass. 37.
c. 30) had served as a centurion in Sulla’s
army, and had the reputation of being a
good soldier. But he was a man of great
expense. He wasted all that he had, and
then wished for more. Arevolution was the
only hope for such a man. These colonists
of Sulla, these old soldiers, who had all at
once become rich, aud had wasted in riot-
ing all that they had gotten, were 0ῃο of
the chief elements of Catilinc's conspiracy.
“ Having wasted their own‚” says Sallust,
“they remembered their former plundcr
and victory, and they longed for civil wa1·.''

aedzficant] They built houses, likc rich
111011, 0110 of the 5111051 roads to ruin (llo-
race, Serm. ii. 3. v. 308). They had thcir

(familiae magnae), and splendid feasting.
Halm, following some MSS„ reads ‘prae-
diis lectis’ instead of ‘praediis, lecticis,’
which reading, he says, offends for several
reasons3 but he does not say what the
reasons are. There is a note on ‘ lecticae'
(Vol. I. Verr. ii. 5. c. ll). Muretus made
the alteration into ‘praediis lectis‚’ and his
authority is ‘liber vetus!

‘Apparare’ 15 3 word that is used in
speaking of feasts. Horace (Carni. i. 38)
has ‘ Persicos odi puer apparatus.’ Cicero
says also in the Verrines (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 4.
c. 20), ‘ornare et apparare convivium.’

ne pecudes quidem] This is an absurd
way of talking that Cicero sometimes falls
into. See Vol. II. In Rullum, ii. c. 4. Halm,
who also finds fault with it, supposes it to
110 3 proverbial kind of expression. He
compares Cicero (Ad Attio i. 16): ‘⁴ Quod
omnes non modo homines verum etiam
pecudes factum esse sciant, id Thalnam et
Plautum 01χο010135 hujusmodi quisquilias
statuere nunquam esse factum.’⁷

10. tztrbnlenlum;] Halm thinks that
this word does not mean ¹ unqnict ' in this
passage; but ‘cheeqncd,’ ‘1›i‹·l›al‹l,’ or
whatever he means by ι11111115011001(111.Π
—‘ gerendo negotio? wc say generally
‘negotium gercre' (which is to be ex-
plained by the composition with ‘otium '),
instead of ‘negotia gercrc’ (Halm). 110
