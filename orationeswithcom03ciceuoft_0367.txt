tam ordinem dicendi meum‚’ 6. l, but Cicero

Cicero's return, but nothing more is known
makes two subdivisions in the answer to

of it. ⁴‘ We must manifestly assume that the

affair of Cicero'shouse must have been already
handled in his absence before the Pontifices
and in his favour. For the words do not
permit us to think of the judgment of the
Pontifices, which they had already given in
their capacity of senators, Perhaps M.
Calidius had spoken at that time, as Gara-
toni conjectured ’⁷ (Κ10ἐΖ).ὴ6 Fuisti . . .
necesse est.' Nothing could be more mean
and miserable than this : “ You were supe-
rior with the Pontifices before; but now
since you have passed to the popular side,
you must of necessity be inferior.” This
feeble antithesis is a characteristic of these
spurious speeches. Cicero had spoken in
the Senate about conferring on Pompeius
the care of the Res Frumentaria, and a
S. C. had been made as he proposed.
Cicero in doing this had done what the
people wished, and the Pontifices would
therefore be unfavourable to him3 as Clo-
dius is supposed to say.

vetustas exemplorum] ‘Exemplorum
vetustas' occurs in the oration Pro Archia,
c. 6.-ί Nondum de mea sententia :' Klotz
says that these words do not refer to ⁴ omit-

VOL. ΙΙΙ.

Clodius' attack which he had already pro-
mised to make (respondebo hominis furiosi
non orationi).

3. emet-citus terrore] The army of Caesar,
which was at the gates, as Manutius says.
But see the oration Quum Senatui, c. 13.
It is the false statement repeated. The vile
consuls are those with whom we are now
very familiar, Piso and Gabinius.

servorum delectu] Baiter has ‘dilectu‚'
following P. G. V has ‘delectu.' This
variation is common. The ‘obsessio tem-
plorum’ applies to Castor’s only. Wolf
observes that ‘oppressione curiae' is not
Ciceronian. Markland takes notice of 1116
strange expression ‘cedere curastis for if
it is Latin, it is still most absurd to say
‘ cedere curavit ’ instead of ⁴ coegit? Baiter
has boldly taken Lambinus’ emendation
‘ cedere coegisti,’ for which there is not the
slightest authority. This is not editing an
author, but altering him.

turbulento illo die] This was the day
when the people were rioting 011 account of
the price of hread (Ad Att. iv. l).-—‘ in Ca-
pitolium intrare turbulento ε’ in some eds.
