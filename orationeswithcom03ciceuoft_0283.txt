Hierosolyma exportari soleret, Flaccus sanxit edicto ne ex Asia
exportari liceret. Quis est, judices, qui hoc non vere laudare
possit? Exportari aurum non oportere, quum saepe antea senatus,
tum me consule gravissime judicavit. Huic autem barbarae super-
stitioni resistere severitatis, multitudinem J udaeorum flagrantem
nonnumquam in contionibus pro re publica contemnere gravitatis
summae fuit—At Cn. Pompeius captis Hierosolymis victor ex illo
fano nihil astigia—In primis hoc, ut multa alia, sapienter, quod in
tam suspiciosa ac maledica civitate locum sermoni obtrectatorum
11011 reliquit. Non enim credo, religionem et Judaeorum et hos-
tium impedimento praestantissimo imperatori, sed pudorem fuisse.
Ubi igitur crimen est? Quoniam quidem furtum nusquam repre-
hendis, edietum probas, judicatum fateris, quaesitum et prolatum
palam non negas, actum esse per viros primarios res ipsa declarat ε
Apameae manifesto comprehensum ante pedes praetoris in foro

temple. So it may be. But l do not sup-
pose that all the gold that the Jews got was
sent to be lodged in the temple. The
money that came into Rome for the pro-
vinces went 0111 again in the way of trade
(Tua Pnovmcn Asm, Vol. 11.); and the
Jews have always known the artos laying
hold of the precious metals. Cicero speaks
of orders being made against the exportation
of gold generally. These prohibitions against
the exportation of the precious metals are
mentioned in the Digest ; and the Jews are
the men who were most active in export-
ing it. There is no doubt that they sent
away the gold in the way of trade, not to
Jerusalem only, but to any place where it was
worth more. The Lex Gabinia, which for-
bade the Provinciales to bon-ow money at
Rome, could have no other object than to
prevent the precious metals from being
carried out of Italy (Cicero, Ad Att. v.

At Cn. Pompeius] A supposed objection
of the prosecutor. Pompeius took Jerusa-
lem, but he did not plunder the temple.
Cicero says, 110 spared it through reasons
of policy. Dion Cassius however (37. c.
16, and note of Reimarus), who always tells
the worst about every body, says that Pom-
peius plundercd the temple. Josephus says
that he entered the holy place and saw
what only the priests ought to see. He saw

a golden table, and a sacred candlestick,
and other things. Though the treasury was
full of gold he took 110110,- 110 was so 1110115
(οὐδενὸς ἥψατο δι’ εὐσέβειαν). Μ. Crassus
who came after 111111 was not so pious. He
robbed the temple.

judicatum] Pantagathus would have ‘in-
dicatum,’ which Baiter accepts. ‘ J udicatum
a senatu‚’ says Manutius.

Apamea] Apamea Cibotus in Phrygia,
near Celaenae. The site is now fixed at
Denair, which 15 determined by an inscrip-
tion which records the erection of a monu-
ment by some Roman ‘negotiatores ’ who
were resident there. lt was a place of great
trade, being on the road to Cappadocia. At
this time it belonged to the province of
Asia. But when Cicero was proconsul of
Cilicia, it belonged to his province (Ad Fam.
xiii. 67) : “ Ex provincia mea Ciliciensi, cui
5015 τρεῖς διοικήσεις Asiaticas attributas
fuisse, nullo sum familiarius usus quam
Androne, Artemonis filio, Laodicensi.” It
seems that it was afterwards attached to Asia
again.—‘Adramyttii ε’ “post hanc vocem

Many Jews resided here. It was 1110 chief

the Colossians, ii. iv.)
