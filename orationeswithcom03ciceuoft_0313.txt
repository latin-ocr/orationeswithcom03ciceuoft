INTRODUOTION. 299

well, and particularly those which Markland supposes that the falsifier
made most use of, the oration In Pisonem and that Pro P. Sesti03 for
these four orations are from one hand, which is as plain as that they
are not from the hand of Cicero.

Those who will undertake the defence of these orations will find more
to do than those who pronounce them not to be Cicero’s. Any person
who has leisure and no better employment may perhaps in some cases
show that what Markland and Wolf have supposed not to be Latin or
Ciceronian is both Latin and Ciceronian: he may show that some of the
objections urged against the genuineness of the orations may be
answered3 and that there are many parts which may be the pure words
of Cicero. All this Ι admit; but he will never convince any man of
sense that the first of Roman writers, a man of good understanding and
a master of eloquence, put together such tasteless, feebIe, and extrava-
gant compositions. Whatever may be the judgment of those who affect
to judge, I would rather they should take me to be as ignorant as they
please of Latin and any thing else, than for a man who can admire what
it is intolerable for me to read and impossible for me to admire.

Ι have copied many of Wolf’s notes instead of giving the meaning in
English. I do not think that a mixture of English and Latin notes is a
good thing, nor that it is generally liked3 and in the notes to the other
orations I have generally stated in English what a commentator has said
in Latin. But in such a case as this, it is better to print many ofWOIf’s
remarks in the original, for a great part of their merit is in the form.
It is not necessary for me to say who he was and what he was. Every
sensible scholar respects his name and can read what he says with plea-
sure‚ even ii he differs from him. He is one of the few critics who is
never dull, and always instructive.
