296 INTRODUCTION.

and thence to his own house. It was the 4th of September, B.c. 57,
when he entered Rome (Pro Sestio, c. 633 In Pison. c. 22).
On the next day he thanked the Senate for their services to him in

a speech entitled Quum Senatui gratias egit or Oratio post reditum in
Senatu (Ad Atticum, iv. 1).

 

There is an edition of four orations of Cicero by F. A. Wolf with this
title: “ M. Tullii Ciceronis quae vulgo feruntur orationes quatuor.
I. Post Reditum in Senatu. II. Ad Quirites Post Reditum. ΙΙΙ. Pro
Domo sua ad Pontifices. IV. De Haruspicum Responsis. Recognovit
Animadversiones integras I. Marklandi et I. Μ. Gesneri suasque
adjecit Frid. Aug. Wolfius. Berolini, 1801.” Wolf's preface contains
the history of the controversy about these four orations, and some
general remarks on them. Markland was the first who called in ques-
tion the genuineness of these orations, “ Remarks on the Epistles of
Cicero to Brutus and of Brutus to Cicer03 in a letter to a friend.
With a Dissertation upon four orations ascribed to M. Tullius Cicero, Sec.
London, 1745.” Gesner in two Praelections 1753, 1754 (Tom. iii.
Commentariorum Soc. Reg. Gottingensis), intitled “Cicero Restitutus,’'
answered Markland's objections3 and it was supposed that he had
answered them so completely that the controversy was settled and the
four orations must pass for genuine. Wolf observes that accordingly
these orations are now not only printed among the other works of
Cicero, but one or two have been admitted for their peculiar eleganoe
among the select orations of Cicero for the study of youth.

Opinion was in favour of the genuineness of these orations at the time
of Wolf, who observes that there is also in their favour the testimony of
Asconius Pedianus, Quintilian, perhaps Ammianus Marcellinus, and
others of less note, as Mamertinus J unior, Servius, the commentator of
Virgil‚ the rhetoricians Aquila and Rufinianus, perhaps also Dion
Cassius, Lactantius, Charisius, and perhaps others who may have escaped
his notice. He remarks that frauds of this kind have often been com-
mitted, and that spurious writings have been ascribed to Cicero, such
as the Oratio pridie quam in exsilium iret, the oration In C. Sallustium
Crispum, an Oratio (le Pace, and an Oratio in Valerium3 and that
we might have had many more, if the declamations had not been lost
which were written in the time of Seneca on the same subjects as Cicero's
genuine speeches ².
