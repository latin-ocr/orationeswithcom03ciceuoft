fit in eos impetns;] Sallust (Cat. c. 45)
says that the Galli, being acquainted with
Cicero’s design, immediately surrendered.
Volturcius made a show of resistance, but
soon yielded. Upon the words ⁴ praetori-
bus nota solis‚' Halm observes, “not even
to the legati, and accordingly it is said in
Sallust: ‘Galli cito cognito consilio sine
mora se praetoribus tradunt’ ⁷¹ But the
word ⁴ cito’ is absurd; and it is properly
omitted in Sallust’s text on the authority of
two MsS. cited by Cortius. Allen (Sallust,
Cat.) observes that ‘ cito ¹ is merely an ab·
breviation of ‘cognita’ Sallust's narrative
shows that the Allobroges expected to be
arrested. ‘ Cito cognito consilio ’ is absurd
in itself, for how could the Allobroges be-
come acquainted with the ‘consilium’ under
these circumstances ‘ cito ?’ Sallust means
to say that the Allobroges did know the
design. Cicero says that they did not.
Drumann remarks (Geschichte Roms, v. p.
490) z “ without doubt the Galli were pre<
viously informed of the attack, though the
place and the particulars were concealed
from them3 Sallust indeed says that they
soon perceived the design, when they were
attacked.'' He has accordingly made his
exposition depend partly on the false word
‘cito' in Sallust. We may understand

why Cicero said that nobody knew what
was going to be done except the two prae-
tors. He did not tell the people of his
secret communication with the Allobroges.
He had done a good deal in detecting the
conspiracy that he would not tell the public.
He would not tell the people whether he
had seen Fulvia, or whether he had given
or promised her money. (Introduction.) If
he did not choose to say that he had com-
municated with the AllobrogeS, he must of
course say that they knew nothing of the
intended attack.

3. Cimbrum Gabinium‚] This is P. Ga-
binius Capito‚ a man of the Equestrian ordo.
Sallust (Cat. c. 17) gives a list of the chief
conspirators. He (Cat. 4⁴) says: “Sed
Allobroges ex praecepto Ciceronis per Gabi-
nium ceteros conveniunt: ab Lentulo, Ce-
thego, Statilio, item Cassio postulant jus
jurandum quod signatum ad cives perferant3
aliter haud facile eos ad tantum negotium
impelli posse. Ceteri nihil suspicantes
dant: Cassius semet eo brevi venturum
pollicetur ac paulo ante legatos ex urbe
pr‹)ficiscitur.” This passage shows why
Cicero sent for these conspirators. Sallust
(Cat. e. 46) says that Lentulus, Cethegus,
Statilius, and Gabinius were sent (οι-ς and
one Caeparius, who did not come, for he
had just heard that all was discovered. Sal-
lust says that the four men came without
dclay.
