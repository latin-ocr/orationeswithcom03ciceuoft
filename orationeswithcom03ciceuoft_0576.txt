562 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

ex gravissimo tum primum desiderio luctuque conspexi, idem etiam
ipsius coloniae Brundisinae, idem, ut scitis, Salutis: quumque me
domus eadem optimorum et doctissimorum virorum M. Laenii
Flacci et patris et fratris ejus laetissima accepisset, quae proximo
anno maerens receperat et suo praesidio periculoque defenderat.
Itinere toto urbes Italiae festos dies agere adventus mei videbantur,
viae multitudine legatorum undique missorum celebrabantur, ad
‚urbem accessus incredibili hominum multitudine et gratulatione
florebat, iter a porta, in Capitolium adscensus, domum reditus erat
ejusmodi, ut summa in laetitia illud dolerem, civitatem tam gratam
tam miseram atque oppressam fuisse. Habes igitur, quod ex me
quaesisti, qui essent optimates. Non est natio, ut dixisti, quod
ego verbum agnovi; est enim illius, a quo uno maxime P. Sestius
se oppugnari videt, hominis ejus qui hanc nationem deleri et con-
cidi cupivit, qui C. Caesarem, mitem hominem et a caede abhor-

idem 3’ and Halm (2) has written ‘redi-
tusque, qui natalis idem.' I have followed
his first edition ; in which the text is as it
stands here, according to the emendation of
Gruter and others.

Cicero's daughter Tullia met him at
Brundisium, but his wife did not (Manu-
tius, quoted by Halm). Manutius refers to
Plutarch (Cicero, c. 41), but in that pas-
sage Plutarch is speaking of Cicero's return
to Brundisium in 13.e. 48. In Β. e. 49 be had
crossed the gulf to Pompeius in Epirus, and
he returned to Italy through Brundisium
after the battle of Pharsalia.

coloniae Brundi.s·inae,] The date of this
‘ colonia’ is Non. Sextil. Rc. 244. Cicero
calls it ‘colonia,’ says Halm, and not a
⁴ municipium,’ because heis speaking of the
Dies Natalis. If he had not spoken of the
settlement of the ‘colonia,’ Ι suppose he
would have called it neither ‘ municipium '
nor ‘colonial Brundisium was a Latina
Colonia.

Salutis ι] The MSS. have ‘idem ut
scitis,' which Manutius altered to ‘idem et
Salutis,' by the aid of the passage in a letter
to Atticus (iv. l) : ‘⁶ Brundisium veni Nouis
Sextil. Ibi mihi Tulliola mea fuit praesto
natali suo ipso die, qui casu idem natalis
erat et Brundisinae coloniae et tuae vicinae
Salutis.’' The temple of Salus was on
the Quirinalis Collis. Nepos in his life of
Atticus speaks of Atticus' house on the
Quirinal.

M. Laeuii Flacci]
Pro Plancio, c. 41, and Ad Div. xiv. 4.
The Flacci received him notwithstanding

Compare the oration

the penalties which the Lex of Clodius con-
tained against those who received Cicero.

dffenclerat. Itinere] Madvig’s conjec-
ture, adopted by Halm (l). But in (2) he
follows the Codd., which have ⁴ defenderat
quumque itinere.’ If Madvig's conjecture
is not accepted, we must take the MSS.
reading, and explain it as well as we can.
But Ι cannot do it.

domum] Not'the Palatina, which Clo-
dius had destroyed, but, as Manutius con-
jectures, the house which he had ‘ in Cera-
mio‚’ Ad Att. iv. 2 (Manutius, quoted by
Halm). Manutius, as usual, refers to the
Book only. There is something about this
Ceramium, or whatever the name should be,
in the notes in the Variorum edition of
Cicero's Letters to Atticus (iV. 3). Manu-
tius must have read this passage thus ε “ Mi-
lonis domum meamque in Ceramio.'⁷ It is
read in Orelli’s edition : ⁴· Milonis domum,
eam quae est in Germalo.'’ But the re-
mark of Manutius is entirely useless, Ι
think; for ‘domum reditus' is simply his
return home. Of course he lodged some-
where when he came back, and if he had
not another house, he might hire one or
borrow the use of one from some of his
friends who were so glad to see him3 his
friend Metellus perhaps, who shed so many
tears (c. 62).

est enim illium] “ Hic erat P. Vatinius,
qui testimonio Sestium persequebatur ’'
(Sehol.). It is the expression of Vatinius,
from whom Albinovanus learned the word.
As to ‘ natio,' see Pro Murena, c. 33.
