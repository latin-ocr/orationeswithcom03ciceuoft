358 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

me frumentum flagitabat? Quasi vero ego aut rei frumentariae
praefuissem aut compressum aliquod frumentum tenerem, aut in
isto genere omnino quidquam aut curatione aut potestate valuis-
sem. Sed homo ad caedem imminens meum nomen operis ediderat,
imperitis injecerat. Quum de mea dignitate in templo J ovis Optimi
Maximi senatus frequentissimus uno isto dissentiente decrevisset,
subito illo ipso die carissimam annonam nec opinata vilitas con-
secuta est. Erant qui deos immortales, id quod ego sentio,
numine suo reditum meum dicerent comprobasse. Nonnulli autem
illam rem ad illam rationem conjecturamque revocabant. qui, quod
in meo reditu spes otii et concordiae sita videbatur, in discessu
autem quotidianus seditionis timor, jam paene belli depulso metu
commutatam annonam esse dicebant3 quae quia rursus in meo
reditu facta erat durior, a me, cujus adventu fore vilitatem boni
viri dictitabant, annona flagitabatur. VII. Ego denique non solum
ab operis tuis impulsu tuo nominabar, sed etiam depulsis ac dis-
sipatis tuis copiis a populo Romano universo, qui tum in Capi-
tolium convenerat, quum illo die minus valerem, nominatim in
senatum vocabar. Veni exspectatus. Multis jam sententiis dictis,

‘ annona ’ and other things. ‘ Potestas ³ is
the authority of a magistratus, Livy (38.
c. 35) says: “Et duodecim clypea aerata
ab aedilibus curulibus, P. Claudio et Ser.
Sulpicio Galba, sunt posita ex pecunia qua
frumentarios ob annonam compressam dam-
narunt.’' The dealers were liable to a pe-
nalty if they did not bring their grain into
market.

in templo Jozvis] “A little before he
named the temple of Concordia'' (Hotm.).
So it is. In the oration Pro Sestio it is the
‘templum Jovis.’ The one dissenter was
Clodius. The Lex for Cicero's recall was
passed on the fourth of August, and imme-
diately after the S. C. Prices, he says, fell
immediately3 which shows that the dealers
had kept their corn back, and that there
was some stoek on hand. Cicero entered
Rome a month later, in September, and
prices were high again. Manutius suggests
that the great concourse of people to Rome
at the ‘ comitia¹ had raised the price, which
may be so3 or there may have been other
reasons.

illam rem ad illam rationem] Cicero
never wrote this way. Wolf says, he who
has accustomed himself to digest any thing
in these orations will not find this too hard.
Again he observes that the union of ‘qui
quod . . . dicebant ¹ is disagrecable, and that

Cicero would have written ‘ ut . . . dicerent’
or something of the kind. But we have also
¹ quae quia‚’ to which there is no objection
in itself, but as a part of this sentence it
helps to make it worse. Ernesti wrote ‘ dic-
titarant,’ for the sake of the Latinity, in
which, says Wolf, we see that he was often
far more careful than this Rhetorician.

7. quum . . . valerem] The feebleness
of this is a sample of the general style of
the speech. “ Finally I was not only
named by your hirelings at your instigation
(impulsus, 110 calls it), but even when your
rout was driven away and scattered‚ the
whole Roman people who had then assem-
bled at the Capitolium, though on that day
1 was not quite well (he was of course at
home), called me by name to the Senate.”
If any man who is used to examine the facts
that are involved in any statement, will read
this carefully, he will see that it is deficient
in all the essentials of a plain and veracious
narrative. As to 1115 health: ‘¹ non admo-
dum grave fuisse videtur periculum: alio·
quin (10 hac valetudine jam antea dicendi
locus fuerat. Sed id membrum bene facit
amplificandae periodo '’ (Wolf).

Multisjam sententiis] C.‚ Baiter. In the
editions the ‘jam ⁹ is generally placed after
⁴ sententiis‚' in the wrong place.
