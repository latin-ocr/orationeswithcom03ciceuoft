the restraint of the Tutela legitima. If
for instance a father wished to secure this
liberty to his daughter, he needed only to
marry her to an old man according to the
law of the sti-iet marriage, though it was
merely a form: the husband however must
not separate himself from the wife, but he
must give her the Tutoris optio by his
testament, and it was precisely for this rea-
son that an old man was absolutely neces-
sary. This connexion between the Tutoris
optio and the Senes is rendered still further
probable by the fact that Cicero puts these
two things in immediate juxtaposition. Thus
also it becomes quite clear, how Cicero
can ascribe the origin of the Tutoris optio
to the invention of the Jurists (Geschichte
der Geschlechtstutel, Vermischte Schriften,
Vol. i. .

This) remark will prepare the way for the
explanation of the next sentence. In the
Roman religion there were religious rites
(sacra) which private persons were bound
to perform, and these ⁴ sacra' called ‘sacra
privata’ to distinguish them from ‘sacra
publica ' were under the superintendence of
the Pontifices. If a Roman vowed certain
offerings, and these were approved by the
Pontifices, he was for ever bound to per-
form them (Cicero, Pro Domo, c. 5l; De
Legg. ii. 19). But to secure this perpetuity,
it was necessary to make this obligation not
so much personal as attached to property,
and to consider it as passing with the
property after death from one person to
another. Such an obligation was only at-
tached to Quiritarian ownership. An ‘ he-
reditas sine sacris' would be a more desira-
ble thing than one with tliem; and the
lawyers devised means of freeing persons
from the obligation of the Sacra. (Savigny,
Ueber die juristische Handlung der Sacra
Privata bei den Romern, &c.‚Ve1·mischte
Schriften, Vol. i.)

savigny supposes, for example, a rich
heiress, who with her father's property had
also received Sacra, from which she wished
to relieve herself. For this purpose she
made a marriage by ‘ coemptio ' with an old
man, the consequence of such form of mar-

riage being that the whole property, as in
the case of succession to an ‘hereditas,'
passed over to the man, and with the pro-
perty consequently also the Sacra (Cicero,
Topica, c. 4). Immediately after the man
separated himself by ‘remaneipatio,⁷ and
gave the property back to the woman by its
several parts, by which return the condition
of the Sacra was not changed again, for
they were attached to the whole (the Uni-
versitas). For the purpose of this return
being made, the man might be bound, as a
precautionary measure, by ‘stipulati011es‚'
which might be made with him by relations
or friends of the wife; for she herself could
not make the ‘stipulationes,’ because her
rights against the man would have been.
destroyed by the ‘ coemptio.' The old man
kept the Sacra as long as he 1ived; and re-
ceived good pay for that purpose without
doubt. As a matter of course an old man
was chosen who would die childless, so that
by his death the Sacra would pei-ish for
ever. The reason for choosing this form of
marriage was this, because in no other way
could a woman who was independent come
into the Patria potestas; for Adrogation
was then and long continued to be impos-
sible in the case of women. It is assumed
all through this explanation that Sacra Pri-
vata are meant and not Sacra Gentilitia.
This is Savigny’s ingenious explanation. 1
know no other that seems to be probable.

has ‘putarunt' As the passage in Gaius
shows (i. 114) ‘coemptio’ was used for
other purposes besides marriage3 but Cicero
here means the ‘coemptio ’ or form of sale
by which a woman came ‘in manum viri :'
“Coempvione in manum conveniunt per
mancipationem, id est, per quandam imagi·

the bride was brought into the husband’s
house, she said in answcr to the question
who she was: “ Vthrc you arc Caius, I am

(Quaestiones Romanae, 30) has something
