294. INTRODUGTION.

He intended to take refuge in Sicily, but the praetor O. Vergilius would
not receive him, and aster going as far as Vibo, he changed his route
and went by land to Brundisium (Pro Cn. Plancio, c. 20). He sailed
from Brundisium to Epidamnus, which the Romans called Dyrrachium,
intending to seek a resting-place on the property which Atticus had in
Epirus. But he soon moved further on and went to Thessalonica in
Macedonia, where he was kindly received by the quaestor Cn. Plancius
and furnished with all that he wanted. He mentions the devoted
affection of Plancius in the speech in which he afterwards defended him
on a charge of Ambitus3 and he dwells particularly on one wretched
night during which Plancius watched and wept with the whining orator
and statesman whose philosophy when put to the test turned out to be
a miser-able sels-delusion (Pro Plancio, c. 42).

To be driven disgracefully from Rome by a faction headed by a dis-
solute young man, to see all his past services forgotten, and to find
most of his friends only concealed enemies, was a terrible calamity to an
honourable man. The separation from wife and children, the destruction
of his property, and of those works of art which he had collected with

much care and at great eost, was a missortune which would move our
sympathy, if it had been endured with calmness and fortitude. But

Cicero's letters during his exile to his wife and to Atticus, instead of
moving our compassion for his sufferings, make us despise him. Such
pitiable, childish sorrows, such idle unmanly talk of suicide, which we
do not suppose that he ever seriously thought of, such complaints of
every thing and every body, such injustice to many of his best friends,
prove his character to have been mean and cowardly3 and in spite of his
great talents and many good qualities, we follow him in his subsequent
career with a feeling of pity and almost of contempt. (Letters to
AtticuS, iii. 3, 1, 13, 19, 223 To Terentia, xiv. 4, 2, 3 ¹.)

Cicero‘s friends at Rome were anxious to recall him from exile, and
popular opinion, which he aptly compares to the wind, soon turned in
his favour. On the kalends of June, about two months after he had
left Rome, the tribune L. Ninnius Quadratus proposed in the Senate

¹ When Cicero was in Macedonia he chanced to meet with a certain Philiscus, whom
he had known at Athens. The philosopher and the statesinan had a long conversation,
which Philiscus began in a very proper tone by saying: ‘⁴ Are you not asllamed, Cicero, of
lamenting and bellaving like a woman? for my part Ι could never have expected you to
show yourself so weak, you who have had the advantage of much and varied discipline,
and have acted as the adviser of many men.’' This is from Dion, who in twelve tedious
chapters repeats the conversation of the Greek and the Roman (38. c. 18, &c.). Cicero
was somewhat relieved by the talk. The readcr certainly will not be relieved, if he
ventures on it. This tasteless Greek, this corrupter of history, treats us withanother
piece of idle talk, when he reports a speech of Caesar to his soldiers before he marched
against the German king (B. G. i. 40). Caesar does it short in his fashion, and we may
suppose that he knew what hc said. Dion gives us eleven chapters (38. c. 36—46).
