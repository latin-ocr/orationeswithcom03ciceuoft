ORATION FOR L. VALERIUS FLACCUS. 233

he tells the truth, much of the evidence against Flaccus was worth
nothing at all.

Flaccus (0.12-14) was charged with levying money on the Pro-
vinciales for the maintcnance of a fleet. Cicero admits that he did, and
he says that there was a fleet3 that Flaccus had authority to raise a
fieet, and that it was wanted. It does not seem that there was any very
minute inquiry into a governor’s expenditure of money raised for such a
purpose. If a fleet was wanted and he got money for a fleet, and
equipped a ficet, there was nothing to say against him. If there was no
fleet, that would seem rather a suspicious matter even to a Roman.

The rest of the oration contains a statement of the charges made
against Flaccus, and the auswer of the orator, or his remarks on the
evidence. His way of dealing with these charges is ingenious. There
seems no doubt that what was offered as evidence was enough to prove
Flaccus’ guilt, if the evidence were accepted and taken as true. Cicero
could not disprove many of the charges, for there are many things
which cannot be directly disproved. The defendant may sometimes be
able to prove facts, which destroy the value of that which the prosecutor
proves; but generally it is not the defendant’s business to disprove,
but the prosecutor’s business to prove. All that the defendant can do
iu many cases is to show that the evidence is not sufficient3 and if it
would be sufficient, if it were true, that it is not sufficient because
the witnesses are unworthy of credit.

The oration contains the answer of Cicero to the charges or the
evidence of several Asiatic communities, Acmona, Dorylaeum, Temnos,
and Tralles. Besides showing the worthlessness of these several charges
and the evidence to support them, witnesses to character were produced
from Athens, Lacedaemon, all Achaia, Boeotia, Thessalia, and Massilia
(c. 26). This is the worst part of Flaccus’ case. Such evidence about
character was intended to be placed against direct evidence of guilt, and
the evidence must have been strong, if there was no way of meeting it
except by the previous good character of Flaccus.

There were also some charges against Flaccus made by Roman
citizens, one by Decianus (c. 29), and another relating to Andro
Sextilius, whose deceased wife's property had been claimed and received
by Flaccus (c. 34). So far as we can judgc, Flaccus was clear of all
blame in the matt-er of this woman’s succession.

The conclusion of the speech (c. 38, ἕω.) is an appeal to the J udices
to protect Flaccus sor the service that he rendered to the state in the
conspiracy of Catilina, and to save him against the men who would ruin
him if they could, and the commonwealth at the same time.

This oration was delivered in Cacsar's consulship, irc. 59, the year
before that in which Cicero went into exile. This fact will explain several
