desperatione confligit. In ejusmodi certamine ac praelio nonne,
etiamsi hominum studia deficiant, dii ipsi immortales cogant ab
his praeclarissimis virtutibus tot et tanta vitia superari? XII.
Quae quum ita sint, Quirites, vos, quemadmodum jam antea [dixi]‚
vestra tecta custodiis vigiliisque defendite: mihi, ut urbi sine
vestro motu ac sine ullo tumultu satis esset praesidii, consultum
atque provisum est. Coloni omnes municipesque vestri, certiores
a me facti de hac nocturna excursione Catilinae facile urbes suas
finesque defendent: gladiatores, quam sibi ille manum certissi-
mam fore putavit, quamquam animo meliore sunt quam pars
patriciorum, potestate tamen nostra continebuntur. Q. Metellus,
quem ego hoc prospiciens in agrum Gallicum Picenumque prae-
misi, aut opprimet hominem aut omnes ejus motus conatusque
prohibebit. Reliquis autem de rebus constituendis, maturandis,
agendis jam ad senatum referemus, quem vocari videtiss'

Nunc illos qui in urbe remanserunt, atque adeo [qui] contra
urbis salutem omniumque vestrum in urbe a Catilina relicti sunt,
quamquam sunt hostes, tamen, quia [nati] sunt cives, monitos [eos]

often stands alone in a clause. ‘Tamen'

Only one MS., it seems, has
may correspond to or be opposed to any

coyant]
‘cogent,' and yet this false reading has

been generally printed. ‘Deficiant' requires
‘ cogant.'

12. jam antea] ‘ Fecistis ’ must be sup-
plied, says Halm. The MSS. reading is
‘jam antea dixi‚’ except one MS. which
omits ‘dixi,’ as Muretus says. Klotz re-
tains ‘ dixi‚’ and he supposeS‚ as some other
critics do, that Cicero refers to the words
‘ Instruite nunc, Quirites,’ &a (0. 11).
But still he thinks that there is a good deal
that is pleasing in the omission of ‘dixi,’
and we must then refer ‘antea,' to all the
past time during which Catilina had caused
alarm 3 and so the expression would resem-
ble that in the twelfth chapter of the third
oration against Catilina: “in vestra tecta
discedite, et ea, quamquam jam periculum
est depulsum, tamen aeque ac priori nocte
custodiis vigiliisque ‹lefendite.”

yladialores,] Ernesti thought that ‘ta-
men ’ in this sentence required ‘ non me-
liore ’ to precede it. He thought that
‘tamen ’ was opposed to ⁴ quamquain.’
But ⁴ potestate tamen ⁷ corresponds to
‘ gladiatores-putavit ;’ and ‘ quamquam—-
patrici‹)rum,’ is a parenthetical relnark;
‘⁴ though they are better than some of the
Patri‹:ii.” Halm in his note says that Er-
nesti’s remark is not without a reason; but
at the end of his note he gives the true ex-
planation of the passage. ‘Quamquam ’

thing. There is no particular adverb to
which it is usually opposed. It is opposed
to a whole phrase. It often has ‘etsi ’ for
its corresponding antecedent, as well as
‘quamquam.’ ‘ Quamquam ' is generally
mistranslated. Cicero says Ad Q. Fratrem
(i. 1. c. 15): “Non est tibi his solis uten-
dum existimationibus ac judiciis qui nunc
sunt hominum, sed iis etiam qui futuri
sunt: quamquam illorum erit verius judi-
cium obtrectatione et. malevolentia libera-
tum.” Here ⁴ quamquam ' means ⁸ however
it may be‚’ ‘take it as you please, so much
as this is certain.'

adeo qni] This ‘qui ’ is wanting in
two sets of MSS. If it is omitted, we must
consider ‘ adeo—relicti sunt ’ as replacing
or correcting ‘remanserunt :’ “Now those
who have stayed behind in the city, or
rather who have been left.’' If ‘qui’ is
printed after ‘ adeo‚’ we may, as Halm say5‚
consider the whole clause ‘ qui in urbe re-
manserunt ' as replaced by · qui—relicti
sunt‚’ subject and predicate, both replaced.
But aster all it makes little differens-e tor the
sense. As to ‘ adco,' see Vol. l. ll. Index.

nali sunl] ‘ Nati ' is doubtful. It
seems enough to Say ⁸ vives ' without ⁴ nati.’
Halm observes that nine MSS. ot* the best
character omit ‘natis—*Mea leuitas adhuc’
means ‘my lenity so far! One set of MSS.
