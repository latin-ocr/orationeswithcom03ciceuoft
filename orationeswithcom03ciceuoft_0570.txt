556 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

Non erat illud quidem verum; non enim ingrati, sed miseri, quibus
reddere salutem a quo acceperant non liceret3 nec unus· in quem-
quam umquam gratior quam in me universi z—sed tamen illud
scripsit disertissimus poeta pro me, egit fortissimus actor non
solum optimus de nie, quum omnes ordines demonstraret, sena-
tum, equites Romanos, universum populum Romanum accu-
saret:
‘⁶ Exsulare sinitis, sistis pelli, pulsum patimini.''

Quae tum significatio fuerit omnium, quae declaratio voluntatis ab
universo populo Romano in caussa hominis non popularis, equidem
audiebam, existimare facilius possunt qui adfuerunt.

LVIII. Et, quoniam huc me provexit oratio, histrio casum
meum toties collacrimavit, quum ita dolenter ageret caussam
meam ut vox ejus illa praeclara lacrimis impediretur-3 neque
poetae, quorum ego semper ingenia dilexi, tempori meo defuerunt;
eaque populns Romanus non solum plausu, sed etiam gemitu suo
comprobavit. Utrum igitur haec Aesopum potius pro me aut
Attium dicere oportuit, si populus Romanus liber esset, an principes
civitatis? Nominatim sum appellatus in Bruto ε

cites Plautus (Trinum. i. l, 2): “immune
facinus,'’ that is ‘ingratum ;' and Cicero

equidem audiebam] The MSS. have
‘audiebamus3’ but the third edition ef

(De Am. c. 14) : “ non est enim inhumana
virtus neque imnmnis,” where some MSS.
have the corrupt reading ‘immanis‚’ as in
this passage all the MSS. have the corrupt
reading ⁶ inanes,' except A. (Orelli). In
the passage of the De Amicitia, ‘immunis'
means, Ι think, ‘does not refuse to dis-
charge its duties.’

illud scripsit . . . pro me,] ¹ Illud ' the
next line, which he is going to quote. After
quoting the first verse, which would seem to
reproach the people with ingmtitude, he
corrects himself3 and he says that they
were not ungrateful, but unfortunate. The
next verse however, ‘Exsulare,y &c., was
so applicable that the poet wrote it for him
(pro me). This is VVesenberg's explana-
tion, who adds something else also to refute
Madvig’s proposal to write ‘pro re ' for
‘ pro me ;' a proposal which one would
hardly expect from such a critic, when
the opposition of ‘scripsit . . . pro me,’
¹ egit . . . de me 'is so obvious.

n07zp0pularis‚] Manutius supposed Cicero
to say that. though he was ⁴ nomine non po-
pularis,’ he had experienced the good will of
the ‘ populus.' Halm explains it right: Cicero
is speaking ironically, for he is thus more
completely refuting the opinion of his ene-
mies about their own popularity.

Ascensius and the edition of Hervagius
have ‘ audiebam) ⁶ Equidem ' is ‘ego qui-
dem‚' or at least it is used in the sense of
‘ ego quidem ’ by Cicero, who only uses it
with the first person; and it would be a
strange use of the word to connect it with
a verb in the first person plural. In this
oration we have an instance of the use of
the word (c. 33): “vos haec melius scire
potestis: equidem audita dico.'' Madvig
in his remarks on this passage had said that
Cicero in his orations does not speak of
himself in the plural number; a remark
which many passages show to be untrue;
for instance, c. 22 of this chapter: ‘¹ C.
Marium . . . ex iisdem quibus nos radicibus
natum ’³ (Halm).

58. Et, quoniam] Halm hasa remark on
⁴ et‚’ that it not only serves to maintain the
continuity of the discourse, but also to an-
nex the particle ⁴ neque ε’ ‘ et histrio colla-
crimavit, neque poetae defuerunt.'

in Bruto :] A play of Attius in which
the name of Tullius occurred, who must be
Servius Tullius the founder of Roman li·
berty. It is an absurd notion of a critic
cited by Halm and of Drumann (ii. p. 294).
that Aesopus the actor changed the name
in lthe play in such way as to signify M.
Tu lius.
