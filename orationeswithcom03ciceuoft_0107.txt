 

ORATION FOR L. MURENA. 93

his client was to give him a good character and divert attention from
the charge of bribery.

Cicero tells us something of the defendant hsurena. He was the
son of L. Licinius Murena, who commanded a division of the Roman
army in the battle of Chaeronea (11.0. 86), in which L. Sulla defeated
Archelaus. He accompanied Sulla to Asia in B.o. 84, in which year
L. Sulla concluded peace with Mithridates, and being in a hurry to
return to Italy, left Murena as Propraetor of the province of Asia.
Murena began a second war against Mithridates without any authority.
(Introduction to the oration De Imp. Cn. Pompeii.)

L. Licinius lssurena the son was summoned into Asia by his father
about B.O. 83, to learn the military art in the campaign against Mithri-
dates. His career is described by Cicero in this oration. He was
Quaestor with Servius Sulpicius, His aedileship is not mentioned3 at
least he did not exhibit any games in it (Drumann‚ Geschichte Roms,
iv. 185). He was a ‘legatus’ of L. Lucullus for several years in the
third Mithridatio war, but he returned from Asia before him. In Β. C.
65 116 was Praetor Urbanus, and gained popularity by the splendour of
his public shows. After his praetorship he had the Provincia of Gallia
Transalpina, otherwise called the Provincia or Gallia Narbonensis.
His career up to the time of his consulship is sketched by Cicero
in this oration.

After BIurena’s acquittal he voted in the Senate for the death of the
conspirators (Ad Att. xii. 21). When Murena entered 011 his consul-
ship in B.o. 62, the conspirators at Rome had been executed, and
Catilina. fell in battle early in B.C. 62. The Roman Laws on bribery at
elections (de ambitu) and some matters connected with bribery are
examined in the Introduction and the notes to the oration Pro Cn.
Plancio.

The edition of this oration in Orelli’s second edition is by Halm, who
has given the readings. I have occasionally cited his MSS. He says:
“non habemus hujus orationis codices saeculo xv vetustioreS, omnesque
ex uno exemplo derivati sunt, quod Poggius initio saeculi xv primus ex
Germania in Italiam portasse dicitur.'' This is one of the many services
that Poggio rendered to the cause of letters.

The following are some of the MSS. used by Halmz—Gr = Codex
Helmstadtiensis, nunc WVolfenbuttelanus3 E = Codex hsonacensis3
M = Codex Monacensis, olim Salisburgensis aulicus: E and M have
been collated by Halm. v z ed. Veneta, a. 1472, collated by Halm.

I have used for this oration some of the older commentators, and an
edition by A. Moebius, revised by G. C. Crusius, 1846. The notes are
abundant, and though they are not very good, they have been sometimes
useful.
