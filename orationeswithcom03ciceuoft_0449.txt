esse accusandum putavi, non plus quam stipitem illum, qui quorum
,hominum esset nesciremus, nisi se Ligurem ipse esse diceret. Quid
enim hunc persequar, pecudem ac belluam, pabulo inimicorum
meorum et glande corruptum? qui si sensit quo sese scelere de-
vinxerit, non dubito quin sit miserrimus; sin autem id non videt,

periculum est ne se stuporis excusatione defendat.

“Exanimatus evolat ex senatu non minus
perturbato animo atque vultu—advocat
contionem, habet orationem talem consul,
qualem numquam Catilina victor habuisset.”
&Vols has this note on ⁴ si vicisset, suisset ’—
“ Quasi odio non nimium dignus fuisset
Clodius, quia praeter ipsum alius non minus
saevus videbatur futurus, Fet-remus si
scripsisset: In me fuit eodem animo, quo et
alii homines improbi in me antea fuerant.'’
Klotz on this passage merely remarks that
Cicero generally represents his opponents
at this period as followers of Catilina, quotes
the passage from the Pro Sestio (e. 12), and
concludes in his usual sels-satisfied way:
“ But a person will not however from this
choose to draw the false conclusion, to
which Wolf here also has allowed himself to
be led.'’ This is as elever as the Decla-
mator.

stipitem illum . . . Liyurem] Aelius
Ligur, the colleague of P. Clodius in the
tribuneship‚ who opposed the motion of
L. Ninnius for Cicero’s return (Manutius).
The words ‘ qui quorum,’ &c., are an allu-
sion to the character of the Ligurian nation,
for it happened that Ligur had a cognomen
which was also the name of a Ligurian (Vol.
11. Pro Cluentio, e. *262 Pro Sestio, 31).

hunc persequar] He means Clodius,
whom he did not prosecute because he was
⁴ pecus et bellua,' and ⁴ corrupted (whatever
it means) by the fodder and mast of Cicero's
enemies.' The reason is amusing. “ Non
accusavit quia bellua est. Longas tamen
orationes in hanc belluam componere non
dedignatur ’' (Wolf).

Accedit etiam . . . valde est iniquum]
hlarkland observes that Milo killed Clodius
more than three years after the date of this
speech, and yet the orator foresees the
event 3 for Markland affirms that the words

imperatoribus obsessam, oppug-

‘ hostia, devota, constituta ¹ prove that he is
speaking of killing Clodius. Gesner shows
that Markland is mistaken‚ that the writer
is speaking ofa prosecution of Clodius by
Milo. He refers to the Pro Flacco, c. 38,
where there are forms of expression like
these, though, as Wolf says, there is a bet-
ter reason in the Pro Flacco for comparing
to a slaughtered victim a man who is con-
demned.

cicero did speak of the probability of ’

Clodius being killed by Milo, but it was in
a letter to Atticus (iv. 3) : ‘⁶ reum Publium,
nisi ante occisus erit, fore a Milone puto : si
se inter viam obtulerit, occisum iri ab ipso
Milone video. Non dubitat facere, prae se
fert, casum illum nostrum non extimescit.’'
Wolf observes, “ Etsi insania absolvas
Rhetorem, facile tamen in sermonis ineptiis
convincetur ε vel dicendum est, quod aliquis
veterum Intpp. dixit non male: Minatur
aperte accusationem, tacite caedem.'' Klotz
admits that there is a hint about the chance
of Clodius meeting with a violent death3
but he contends that this is no evidence of
the forger. And I think so too. The
evidence of the forger is not in that sug-
gestion ; but it is in the whole chapter.

The comparison which follows in the next
chapter about Scipio and Carthage is very
extravagant; and though we see that the
writer at the end of this chapter is speaking
of Clodius being brought to trial, he will
not be content with that, but must speak
as if Clodius were to be killed.

4. multis imperatoribus] He seems to
mean many Roman ‘imperatores ¹ who had
besieged Carthage, but we do not know
their names. ‘Paene captam ’ is in the
author’s style. (Quum Senatui, c. 15.)
—‘adventu,’ C.‚ Baiter.
have ⁴ eventu.’
