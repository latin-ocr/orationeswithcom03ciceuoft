284 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

epistolam habituram ponderis quam ipsius praesentis fictam vocem
‘et simulatum dolorem ἓ

Sed quid ego de epistolis Falcidii aut de Androne Sextilio aut de
Deciani censu tamdiu disputo [et postulo], de salute onmium nos-
trum, de fortunis civitatis, de summa re publica taceo? quam
vos universam in hoc judicio vestris, vestris, inquam, humeris,
judices, sustinetis. Videtis in quo motu temporum, quanta in
conversione rerum ac perturbatione versemur. XXXVIII. Quum
alia multa certi homines, tum hoc vel maxime moliuntur, ut vestrae
quoque mentes, vestra judicia, vestrae sententiae optimo cuique
infestissimae atque inimicissimae reperiantur. Gravia judicia pro
rei publicae dignitate, multa de conjuratorum scelere fecistis. Non
putant satis conversam rem publicam, nisi in eandem impiorum
poenam optime meritos cives detruserint. Oppressus est O. Anto-
nius. Esto: habuit quandam ille infamiam suam: neque tamen
ille ipse, pro meo jure dico, vobis judicibus damnatus esset, cujus
damnatione sepulcrum L. Catilinae, floribus ornatum, hominum
audacissimorum ac domesticorum hostium conventu epulisque
celebratum est, justa Catilinae facta sunt. Nunc a Flacco Lentuli
poenae per vos expetuntur. Quam potestis P. Lentulo, qui vos
in complexu liberorum conjugumque vestrarum trucidatos incendio
patriae sepelire conatus est, mactare victimam gratiorem quam si L.
Flacci sanguine illius nefarium in [nos] omnes odium saturaveritis?

disputo] ‘Disputo et postulo ' T. ‘ Dis-
puto? postulo' S. A. F. Some editions have

that he has good right to say this.
sepulcrum] He is either speaking orato-

‘disputo et expostulo‚' which Lambinus
restored, as he says, ‘ex auctoritate codd.
11101111111111113-ί de summa re publica! there
is the usual variation ‘de summa rei pub-
licae!

38. C. Ausonius] Cicero's colleague in
the consulship (see c. ‘2 of this oration).
Cicero says that C. Antonius would not
have been convicted if the ‘judices’ who
sat on Flaccus’ trial had been the ‘jndices '
of Antonius Garatoni concludes from this
passage that the trial of Flaccus took place
after the cnactmcnt of the Lex Vatinia de
rejectione judicum (see c. 6 of this oration,
and note 011 ‘hac lcge'). Cicero (In
Vatin. e. ll) has a passage which begins:
‘¹ Et quoniam crebro usurpas legem te de
alternis consiliis rejiciendis tulisse& ἃς.
Antonius had not the benerit of the chal-
lenge when hc was tried, and this will ex-
plain what (iit-cro says.

pro meo jure diem] ⁴ Ι have good right
to say it! The context shows why he says

rically, in other words, falsely 3 or we must
suppose that a cenotaph was raised to Cati-
lina’s memory, that it was crowned with
flowers ; and that there was eating and
drinking in honour of the traitor, as there
was 111 honour of better men (Pro Murena,
c. 36). Funeral pomp was a Roman
fashion, and the place where the body was
burnt or where the ashes were placed was
frequented by those who lamented the dead.
Caesar’s ⁶ bustum ' was visited by the Jews
for many successive nights (Sueton. Cae-
sar, c. 85). A long time after Nero’s death
there were persons who decorated his tomb
with the flowers of spring and autumn, a
sign of affection for a man whom we should
havc supposed to have left 110 t‘ricnd behind
him (Sueton. Nero, (·. 57).

Leululi] The praetor who was strangled
for his share in Catilina’s conspiracy (Introd.
to the orations against Catilina). Cethegus
was another os the conspirators who was
punishcd.
