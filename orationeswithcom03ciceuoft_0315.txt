honoribus] The ‘honores’ conferred by
the Roman people gave a man the capacity
of entering the Senate (amplissimum con-
silium), The ‘quaestura' qualified a man
for the Senate. The ⁴ altissimus dignitatis
gradus' is the consulship; and the ‘om-
nium terrarum arce' is the Curia, as Manu-
tius correctly explains it. In the oration
Pro Sulla, c. ll, he calls Rome “arcem
regum ac nationum exte1·arum.'’ See the
oration Pro Milone, c. 33, “templum sanc-
titatis‚'’ διο.

Wolf finds fault with the end of the
sentence ⁴ ut, quum multa . . . recuperaveri-
mus‚' in which nothing fresh is said, and
the climax is made in very inept terms,
‘ multa, magna, innumerabilia 3’ the last of
which (innumerabilia) have already been
numbeoed, and they are four3 therefore not
past numbering. Klotz remarks that those
only could mistake the sense of the first
part of the sentence (cujus honoribus . . .
collocati sumus) who took offence at the
very natural climax ‘multa‚ magna, innu-
merabilia, omnia.’ This is an answer to
Wolf, whom he does not name, and a spe-
cimen of his way of defending the Decla-
mator.

quod vobis debeamus,] ‘ debeamus mei et
Lag. omnes,' Halm, who explains it ‘im-
mensum vobis deberi nobis videmur (ὀφεί-
λοιμεν ἅν),’ which is not the true explana-
tion. ‘ Quod vobis debeamus' is simply
⁴ the debt.’ He does not say ‘id quod vobis

debemus immensum,’ &c.; but he puts it
in another and a more general form. See
Pro Sulla, c. 7, note on ‘qui ex municipiis
veniant.'

2. immortalitatem] Wolf compares In
Pis. c. 3: “ Mihi populus Romanus univer-
sus illa in contione non unius diei gratula-
tionem, sed aeternitatem immortalitatemque
donavit.'’ See Pro Sestio, c. 54, “plausum
immortalitatem.''

L. Ninnio] On the first of June, B.c.
58. (See the Introduction.) This is one
of the passages which Wolf alleges as evi-
dence of this speech being the work of some
declamator. He says, “ No, the Senate
spoke freely even in the third month after
Cicero’s departure, since on the motion of
Ninnius a full Senate voted for Cicero's
recall, and only one tribune opposed it ; for
which we have the evidence of the speech
Pro Sestio, c. 3l.” This discrepancy seems
to me to have no great weight as an argu-
ment against the genuineness of this speech ;
but in these spurious orations we find every
thing magnified ; and this passage is one of
those in which facts are stated stronger
than in the genuine specches. Indeed they
are different facts, for in the oration Pro
Sestio (c. 31) it is not said that the Senate
was threatened at that time.

The ⁴ eum tribunum ' whom he does not

name is perhaps Aelius Staienus. This is
