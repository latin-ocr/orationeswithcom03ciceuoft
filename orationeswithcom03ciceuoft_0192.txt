]78 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

lisse. Ο dii immortales l—-vobis enim tribuam quae vestra sunt3
nec vero possum meo tantum ingenio dare ut tot res, tantas, tam
varias, tam repentinas, in illa turbulentissima tempestate rei pub-
licae mea sponte dispexerim—vos profecto animum meum tum
conservandae patriae cupiditate incendistis3 vos me ab omnibus
ceteris cogitationibus ad unam salutem rei publicae convertistis;
vos denique in tantis tenebris erroris et inscientiae clarissimum
lumen menti meae praetulistis. Vidi ego hoc, judices, nisi recenti
memoria senatus auctoritatem hujus indicii monumentis publicis
testatus essem, fore ut aliquando non Torquatus, neque Torquati
quispiam similis, nam id me multum fefellit, sed ut aliquis patri-
monii naufragus, inimicus otii, bonorum hostis, aliter indicata haec
esse diceret, quo facilius vento aliquo in optimum quemque excitato
posset 111 malis rei publicae portum suorum malorum aliquem inve-
nire. Itaque introductis in senatum indicibus, constitui senatores
qui omnia indicum dicta, interrogata, responsa perscriberent. At
quos viros ; 11011 50111111 summa virtute et fide, cujus generis erat 111
senatu facultas maxima, sed etiam quos sciebam memoria, scientia,
consuetudine et celeritate scribendi facillime quae dicerentur per-

auctoritalem hujus indicii] ‘If Ι did feet record. It is true that those who had

not, while the mcmory of the Senate was
fresh, secure evidence of the credibility of
the information by putting it on record,’ as
we say, or ‘ by entering it on the public
records.'

patrimonii naufraffltsu] Ernesti suspected
‘ patrimonii.’ which Halm has, on the au-
thority of T. V. The other MSS. have
‘ patrimonio.' I cannot find the expression
any where else.

vento aliquo] Aword sometimes used to
express popular opinion, which is said to
be unsteady as the wind. Horace (Carm.
iii. 2) speaks of the ‘popularis aura.'

At quos viro.9‚·] ‘And what men :’ Cicero
is fond of this turn, which belonged to the
language of common life. Vol. I. Verr. ii.
2. c. 45; Vol. II. Pro Fonteio, c. 17.

scientia, eonsuetwline et celet-ilate] A. V.
omit ‘consuetudine3' and Halm omits it.
Halm says that in reading ‘scientia ’ we
must not think of short-hand. He explains
⁴ memoria’ to mean that they could com-
pletely catch all that was said; and ‘sci-
entia' that they could write it down with
accuracy in compact form. I hardly un-
derstand what 110 means. The writers would
of course take the evidence down just as it
was delivered. If the evidence was not
taken down at the time, but written down
afterwards from meinory, it was an imper-

the best memory would be the best men to
record the evidence, if they were honest,
whether they put it in writing at the time
or afterwards. But when Cicero says ‘ ce-
leritate scribendi facillime quae dicerentur
persequi posse‚' it is plain that their ready
penmauship was exercised in taking down
the words as they were spoken. Perhaps
they took down the evidence in the ordinary
way of writing, with no more abbreviation
than was used in common writing, for the
evidence thus recorded could be read by
every man. But Cicero may mean short-
hand writing. Plutarch (Cato, 0, 23) speaks
of the men whom Cicero employed to take
down Cato‘s speech on the punishment of
the conspirators‚ as having used short-hand
(Introduction to the Orations against Cati-
lina). The Romans used many abbrevia-
tions in writing; and also writing in cipher
was used by C. Julius Caesar (Gellius, xvii.
9). There was a book of the Grammarian
Probus ‘ de occulta litterarum significatione
epistolarum C. Caesaris scriptarum.' But
this has nothing to do with 1110 present
matter. The Romans had a short-hand in
general use, as we see from Martial and
other writers. In this case, it is at least
certain that the evidence was taken down
as it was delivered, and taken down by
ready writers. They might, as already ob-
