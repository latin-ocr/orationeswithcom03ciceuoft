show 111 3 111018 unfavourable light the
riotous and unwholesome character of the
proceedings adopted by Clodius. Space
forbids to go deeper here into particulars.
In most passages however all depends on
the point of view from which we consider
them, and we think that we have given
hints enough.'’

interrae] The name and the office ori-
ginated 111 1118 kingly period. When a king
died, a successor was elected, and the ino·
terval between the death of one king and
the election of another was an Interregnum.
An ‘interrex ¹ was named during this time,
or several ⁴ interreges ’ in 511888551011, 35 501118
authorities say. The name continued during
the Republic and the office also, and an
‘interrex’ was occasionally chosen. He
must bc a patrician 31111 01105811 by the
pati-inians. The technical word is ⁴ prodere,’
which is used here (Liv. iii. 403: “quae
patricios coire ad prodendum interregem
jubebat.'' Baiter has altered the old read-
ing ⁴ a patricio prodi’ to ⁴ a patriciis prodi 3’
for Livy says (vi. 41): ‘⁴ut nos quoque
ipsi (patricii) sine suffragio populi auspi-
cato regem prodamus.''

The writer has used plenty of terms, but
what is it that he says? The ‘auspicia ' of
the Populus Romanus must perish, if pa-
trician magistratus are not elected, there
being no ⁴ interrex‚' for the ‘interrex ’ must
be a patrician and elected by the patricians.
He who can divine what all this means
may explain it: not I. “Davus sum, 11011
Oedipus.'’

15. Venio ad auyures] He does not
speak here as if they were present (8. 13).
Α 111311 could not tell from what follows
whether or not the writer supposed them to
be present. Three augurs were present at
the enacting of a Lex Curiata (Cicero, Ad
Att. iv. 18). But they had nothing to do
here. Ferraffius, as already obser-ved, Ma-
nutius, and Klotz find no way out of the
difficulty, except by supposiug that some os

Negant fas esse agi cum populo, quum de caelo serva-
Quo die de te lex curiata lata esse dicatur, audes negare

the Pontifices were also Augurs. When
Cicero (Ad Att. iv. 2) speaks of the judg-
ment given about his house, he says nothing
of the augurs ; 31111 for a good reason. The
augurs had nothing to do with the question.
Even here the Declamator says (e. 14) z
⁴⁴ Dico apud pontifices.'⁷

Cicero was ‘curiosus ’ about these mat-
ters or pretended to be, when he wrote 0118
of his letters to Appius Claudius (Ad Fam.
iii. 9)· “Quum ipsam cognitionem juris
augurii consequi cupio. '’ Appius had dedi-
cated to Cicero the first part of a work on
augury (Liber Auguralis, Ad Fam. iii. 4).
Cicero also wrote a work De Auguriis still
later, when he was an augur (De Legg.
ii. 8).

contionibus] This genuine orthography
is now established. P. has ⁴ contionibuzss
G. ⁴ conditionibus ' with cli erased3 and V.
has the faulty reading ⁴ condicionibus! Fur-
ther on in this chapter P. G. have ‘con-
tione!

leoe curiata] Compare De Provinciis
00115. 80. 17, 19. Τ118 Lex Curiata for
Clodius’ adrogation. Bibulus was Caesar's
colleague 111 1118 consulship, and he declared
the ‘auspicia' to be against the proceedings
of the day. Every thing at Rome was done
with a religious ceremonial: “Nihil pub-
lice sine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae ge-
rebatur ⁷' (De Divin. i. 2). One of the forms
of the ⁴ auspicia' was derived from observing
the heavens, about which there is a long
passage in Dionysius (ii. 5). This practice
is expressed by the words ⁴ servare de cae10‚'
as Ad Atticum, ii. 16: “Bibulus de caelo
tum servasset necne, sibi quaerendum non
fuisse.⁷ ⁷’ The‘ servare de caelo' did not
8011515 st in obs erving certain ceremonies 35
1188855 ary prelimiffaries to the bus 5111855. It
was something observed lae-fore the business
began, or 53111 to bc observ ed3 and the 118-
claration of this observation by a competent
magistratus stopped the business of the day
(Philipp. ii. 32).
