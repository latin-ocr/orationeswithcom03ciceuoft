CAP. 4—6. 161¹)

Lentulo? quae tanta societas ullis inter se rerum optimarum,
quanta ei cum illis sceleris, libidinis, audaciae? Quod flagitium
Lentulus non cum Autronio concepit? quod sine eodem illo Catilina
facinus admisit? quum interim Sulla cum eisdem illis non modo
noctem solitudinemque non quaereret, sed ne mediocri quidem ser-
mone et congressu conjungeretur. Illum Allobroges, maximarum
rerum verissimi indices, illum multorum litterae ac nuntii coar-
guerunt : Sullam interea nemo insimulavit, nemo nominavit. Post-
remo ejecto sive emisso jam ex urbe Catilina, ille arma misit,
cornua, tubas, falces, signa, legiones: ille relictus intus, exspectatus
foris, Lentuli poena compressus, convertit se aliquando ad timorem,
numquam ad sanitatem. Hic contra ita quievit ut eo tempore omni
Neapoli fuerit, ubi neque homines fuisse putantur hujus affines sus-
picionis, et locus est ipse non tam ad inflammandos calamitosorum
animos quam ad consolandos accommodatus. VI. Propter hanc
igitur tantam dissimilitudinem hominum atque caussarum dissimilem
me in utroque praebui. Veniebat enim ad me, et saepe veniebat
Autronius multis cum lacrimis supplex ut se defenderem3 et se

salces,] “Pal. nonus fasces probabili
emendatione, sed forsan minus vera ’¹
(Gruter). V. S. and Halm have ‘fasces.'
Halm in his note remarks, that the men-
tion of ⁴ fasces ¹ is an addition of Cicero’s,
and he refers to Sallust (Cat. c. 36) who
says of Catilina, “ cum fascibus atque aliis
imperii insignibus in castra ad Manlium
contendit.'’ But this passage does not ap-
pear to be of any weight here. T. Β. and
most of the MSS. have ‘ falces ;’ Lambinus
says that some MSS. have ‘faces.’ It is
difficult to say what the true reading is.
Ant. Augustinus suggested that we should
read ‘signa legionis,’ in order to remove
the difficulty about Autronius being said to
have sent legions. Catilina had at first only
2000 men, and hardly raised his force to
two legions (Sallust, Cat. c. 56). One
critic suggests that ‘legiones' should be
omitted. In some editions there is ‘ligones’
in place of ¹ legiones,' but we cannot accept
that. ‘Siyna‚ liyones, cod. Genevensis'
Halm .
( qumi-it] The Scholiast quoted by Halm
has a good note on ‘quievit.' It might
have been supposed that Sulla retired after
his condemnation, because he was conscious
of his offence being detected3 but the ora-
tor makes this an argument to show the

cumstance of Cicero speaking, as if Sulla
after being convicted of bribery could not
stay in Rome, for the Lex Calpurnia al-
lowed him to stay. Those who before his
time were convicted under the Lex Cornelia
were excluded for ten years from being
candidates for a magistratus. The Lex
Calpurnia (3.0. 67) imposed a pecuniary
penalty and perpetual incapacity to hold
a magistratus; but persons convicted under
it could still stay at Rome. In the consul-
ship of Cicero and C. Antonius a Lex
Tullia added ten years’ exile to the former
penalties for bribery.

Neapoli] This ancient Greek city had a
Foedus with Rome at an early period (Liv.
viii. 26). After the enactment of the Lex
Julia it had the Roman ‘civitas’ Halm
observes that it had the ‘jus exilii,’ or was
one of the places to which a Roman could
retire into ‘exilium ;’ and so the practice of
retiring there from Rome continued after it
had received the ‘cix-itas? But Neapolis
was a pleasant residence and a luxurious
city, and the Romans went there because
they liked it. A Roman who loved his ease
and pleasure would ehoose Neapolis in pre-
ference to most Italian towns.
