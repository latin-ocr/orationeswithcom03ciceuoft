ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 7

design the ruin of the State. He added a sneer against Cicero's origin,
and was going on in thersame way, when his voice was drowned by the
cries of the Senate, who denounced him as an enemy and a traitor.
Catilina hurried from the Senate with threats of vengeance, and late on
the same night left the city for the camp of Manlius (Sallust, Cat. 313
Appian, B. C. ii. 2). On his road he wrote to some of the most* dis·
tinguished men in Rome that he was going to retire to Massilia, the
victim of calumny and of a hostile faction. The conspirators who stayed
in Rome set abroad the same report with the purpose of making Cicero
unpopular (In Cat. ii. 6).

On the next day, the ninth of November, Cicero delivered the Second
oration against Catilina, which is addressed to the people. He endea-
voured to quiet the alarm of the city, and to deter the conspirators who
remained in Rome from prosecuting their desperate designs.

Catilina on his road wrote a letter to Q. Catulus, of which Sallust
(Cat. 36) has preserved the copy. The historian says that the letter is
genuine, and it looks like a genuine production of a villain and a hypo-
crite who does not know what to say. He complains of being an injured
man, but does not say clearly what he is going to do. His object in
writing was to recommend his wife Aurelia Orestilla to Catulus’ care.
A few days after Catilina left Arretium (Arrezzo) in Etruria, and
entered the camp of Manlius with the fasces and the other insignia of
consular power. XVhen the news reached Rome, the Senate declared
Catilina and Manlius to be enemies; they also fixed a day before the
expiration of which a pardon was offered to all who would leave Catilina,
except those who were condemned of capital crimes. But neither the
offer of reward had induced a single person to give information about
the conspiracy, nor did the promise of pardon draw one single man from
the camp of Catilina3 “with such violence‚” says Sallust, “just like a
plague, had this pestilent affair laid hold of men’s minds.''

Sallust has explained his meaning in two short chapters (c. 37, 38).
It was not the conspirators only who were discontented with the present
state of affairs. All the class, which Sallust comprehende under the
name of Plebs, wished for a revolution, and were in favour of Catilina.
The historiau means, as his words show, not the class of the Plebeii as
opposed to any other class3 he means the men who had nothing, who
would not or could not work, and yet would live and enjoy. Rome was
full of desperate, abandoned men. The most profligate and the most
impudent; those who had wasted their estates3 all who had been driven
from home by their scandalous life or their crimes flocked to Rome.
The city like a cesspool received the filth and drainage of all Italy.
Men remembercd too thc times of Sulla. They saw some who had
