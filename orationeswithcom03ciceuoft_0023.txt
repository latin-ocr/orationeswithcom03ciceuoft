ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 9

of Sallust on the state of Rome at this critical time3 which he has
expressed with a clearness and precision that we seldom see in a modern
writer.

The consul Antonius was appointed to command the army against
Catilina. Cicero was to stay in Rome and watch over the city. But
the praetor P. Cornelius Lentulus Sura, and O. Cornelius, a senator,
two of Catilina’s foremost partisans, were still in Rome, and doing all
that they could to further the object of the conspiracy. The plan was,
that, when Catilina with his troops was in the territory of Faesulae, the
tribune L. Bestia was to harangue the people, and charge Cicero with
being the cause of all the troubles. On the following night the con-
spirators were to execute the several duties that were assigned to
them. Statilius and Gabinius with a large body of men were to fire
the city in twelve different places. Cethegus was to get possession of
the entrance to Cicero's house and murder him. There were even sons,
the greater part of them of noble families, who were to murder their
own fathers. In the midst of the confusion the conspirators would
break out of the city and join Catilina. Cethegus complained of delay
and of the cowardice of his associates: he would have gone to work
immediately. At last the Saturnalia, the leth of December, was the
day fixed for the execution of the plot. Cicero knew all; but he could
not venture to do any thing till he had complete evidence. The con-
spirators themselves soon furnished him with it.

At this time there was in Rome a deputation from the Allobroges, a
Gallio people who lived between the lake of Geneva and the Rhone.
They had come to complain to the Senate of the Roman provincial
government and of the debt they were burdened with3 and they were
dissatisfied at finding no hope of redress. Lentulus sent one P. Umbre-
nus to these men to sound their disposition, and to promise them relief if
their nation would help Catilina with a body of cavalry (In Cat. iii. c. 4).
The Allobroges saw some hope for their people in the proposals of
Umbrenus3 they said they were ready to do any thing that would
release their country from its difficulties. Umbrenus took them into
D. Brutus' house, which was near the Forum. Sempronia, Brutus’
wife, was in league with the conspirators3 and her husband, who knew
nothing about it, was from home. Umbrenus invited Gabinius to the
house to give 111010 weight to the proposal, and 111 his presence 110 told
the ambassadors of the whole plot. The Allobroges long hesitated what
they should do; but, as the historian sayS, Rome’s Fortunc prevailcd
(“ tandem vicit fortuna rei publicae,'' c. 41). They disclosed the con-
spiracy to Q. Fabius Sanga, the chief patron of their State. Sanga went
to Cicero with the news, who told the ambassadors to pretend that they
were hearty in the conspiracy3 to see others of the conspirators‚ and to
