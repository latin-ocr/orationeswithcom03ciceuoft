ORATION FOR L. MURENA. 91

Stoics, ridiculed and mocked these philosophers and their so-called para-
doxes, and thus made the J udices laugh. On which it is said that Cato,
with a smile, observed to those who were present, ‘ My friends, what a
ridiculous consul we have !’ ’‘

Cicero’s friend Servius Sulpicius was about the same age as Cicero.
He studied oratory with him, and accompanied him to Rhodes in ac.
78. He afterwards devoted himself to jurisprudence upon the sugges-
tion of the Pontifex Q. Mucius Scaevola, himself one of the best and
most illustrious of the Romans. We know more of Servius than Cicero
tells us in this oration, and our authority for his great talents and
virtues is Cicero himself. He was a man of strict integrity, great
industry, and of a clear and solid judgment. On his return from
Rhodes, says Cicero (Brutus, c. 41), he seems to me to have preferred
being the first in the second art (jurisprudence) to being second in the
first (oratory) 3 and I am inclined to think he might have equalled the
first orators, but perhaps he preferred, and he certainly accomplished it,
to be the first not only of all the men of his age, but even of those
before him in the civil law. He adds that Scaevola and many others
had great practica] knowledge of the law, but Servius alone possessed it
as an art. However he would never have accomplished this by the
mere knowledge of law, if 116 had not also learned the art which teaches
us to distribute the whole matter of a thing into its parts, to develope
by definition that which is not apparent, and to explain by interpreta-
tion what is obscure3 the art which teaches us first to see what is
ambiguous, and then to separate it: finally, the art which gives us a
rule for determining what is true and what is false, and what conclu-
sions follow and what do not follow from the premises. For Servius
brought to the study of the law this art, the first of all arts, which may
be compared to a light thrown on those things which others treated
obscurely either in their legal opinions or in their spoken arguments.
Cicero explains this art to be Dialectic, to which Servius added literary
acquirements, and elegance of language, as his writings, with which no
others can be compared, easily show. This is Cicero's judgment of the
man, whose talents and character made him the first of jurists, an
excellent orator, a skilful advocate, an example of a noble and elevated
character such as Rome only has produced.

Servius was a very voluminous writer. He is often cited in the
Digest‚ but there is no excerpt from his writings. Quintilian (Inst. x.
1, and 7) speaks of three orations of Servius being extant in his time,
one of which was his speech against Murena, the destruction of which

is a real loss to literature. Two letters of Sulpicius to Cicero arc in the ⁴

collection of Cicero's letters Ad Familiares, one of which (Lib. iv. 5)
is the letter written from Greece in which he consoles his friend for the
