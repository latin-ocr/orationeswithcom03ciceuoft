212 ORAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

hominibus liberalissimisque studiis affluenti, celeriter antecellere
omnibus ingenii gloria contigit. Post in ceteris Asiae partibus
cunctaque Graecia sic ejus adventus celebrabantur, ut famam ingenii
exspectatio hominis, exspectationem ipsius adventus admiratioque
superaret. Erat Italia tum plena Graecarum artium ac disciplina-
rum, studiaque haec et in Latio vehementius tum colebantur quam
nunc iisdem in oppidis, et hic Romae propter tranquillitatem rei
publicae non negligebantur. Itaque hunc et Tarentini et Regini et
Neapolitani civitate ceterisque praemiis donarunt, et omnes qui
aliquid (le ingeniis poterant judicare cognitione atque hospitio
dignum existimarunt. Hac tanta celebritate famae quum essct
jam absentibus notus, Romam venit Mario consule et Catulo.
Nactus est primum consules eos, quorum alter res ad scribendum

antecellere . . . contiyit] Halm remarks
that this construction with the intinitive 15
only found in this passage of Cicero, though
it is usual in the poetS, and in the prosc
writers after the first century of the Chris-
tian aera.

adventus] There is a reading ‘ celebran-
tur! See the note on ‘adventus' Vol. I.
Verr. ii. 1. c. 193 and Vol. II. De Imp.
Cn. Pompeii, c. 5; De Lege Agraria, i. 3.
‘Adventus' is used in this sense both in
the singular and in the plural.

Italia] Italia, South Italy, is opposed to
Latium, the country of the Latin tongue.
Archias came to Italy before the Marsic
war which desolated the country3 and the
Marsic war was followed by the wars of
Marius and Sulla. From the death of C.
Gracchus B.c. 121, to the commeneement
of the Marsic war B.c. 90, Italy was quiet ;
and Rome was as quiet as such a place
could be. The invasion of the Cimbri and
Teutones, which threatened Italy, was re-
pelled by Marius and Catulus 13.c. 102,

Tarentini] Tarentum, a Greek town on
the south coast of Italy, had received a
Romana colonia in B.c. 123 or 122 (Velleius,
i. 15). Cicero seems to be speaking of the
Greek population only; he takes 110 notice
of the Roman colony. Rhegium or Regium
(Reggie) at the extremity of Italy, and
Neapolis (Napoli) were Civitates Foede-
ratae, and as such preserved their internal
constitution. It was a principle among the
Greek states that a man might be a citizen
of more states than one, as Cicero says in
the oration Pro Balbo, c. 12.

G. E. S. A. write Regini. One sees no
reason for Rhegini, but it is the common

way of writing the word in our printed
books.

alter...alz¹er] Marius did the deeds
which furnished Archias with materials, but
he was a rough soldier and had no taste sor
letters. Plutarch (Marius c. 2): ‘⁴ It is
stated that Marius never studied Greek lite-
rature, and never availed himself of the
Greek language for any serious purpose, for
he said it was ridiculous to study a litera-
ture the teachers of which were the slaves
of others; and after his second triumph,
when he exhibited Greek plays (shows) on
the occasion of the dedication of a certain
temple, though he came to the theatre, he
only sat down for a moment and then went
away.'' Marius’ colleague Q. Lutatius Ca-
tulus was both a soldier and a man of let-
ters (Plutarch, Marius, c. 25; Brutus, c.
35). Cicero commends the purity of his
Latin style. He wrote a book on his con-
sulship and his campaigns, which was pro-
bably of the character of commentarii or
Memoires pour servir. He wrote verses
too. Cicero (De Natura Deorum i. 28)
quotes an Epigram by Catulus on the actor
Roscius3 and Gellius (xix, 9) quotes some
verses by Catulus, which are perhaps a
translation from the Greek, certainly not
elegant. Catulus is mentioned in the ora-
tion Pro C. Rabirio, e. 7. He perished
B.c. 87 111 Marius’ proscription. His piti-
less colleague said to those who inter-
ceded for Catulus, ‘He must die,' and
accordingly Catulus shut himself up in a
room, and lighting some chareoal suffocated
himself (Plutarch, Marius, c. 44). His son,
who is mentioned in this chapter, was con-
sul in 13.c. 78, censor 111 ss.c. 65, and one of
the leaders of the Optimates.
