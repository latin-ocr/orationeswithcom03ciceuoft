46 ORAT. II. IN L. CATILINAM

premuntur, qui numquam emergun‘t3 qui partim inertia, partim
male gerendo negotio, partim etiam sumptibus in vetere aere alieno
vacillant, qui vadimoniis, judiciis, proscriptione bonorum defa-
tigati, permulti et ex urbe et ex agris se in illa castra conferre
dicuntur. Hosce ego non tam milites acres quam infitiatores lentos
esse arbitror. Qui homines primum, si stare non possunt, corruant;
sed ita ut non modo civitas sed ne vicini quidem proximi sentiant.
Nam illud non intelligo quamobrem, si vivere honeste non possunt,
perire turpiter velint; aut cur minore dolore perituros se cum
multis quam si soli pereant arbitrentur. Quintum genus est par-
ricidarum, sicariorum, denique omnium facinorosorum, quos ego a
Catilina non revoco; nam neque divelli ab eo possunt, et pereant
sane in latrocinio, quoniam sunt ita multi ut eos carcer capere non
possita· Postremum autem genus est, non solum numero, verum
etiam genere ipso atque vita, quod proprium est Catilinae, de ejus
delectu, immo vero de complexu ejus ac sinu, quos pexo capillo,

compares ‘negotii gerendi studio' (Pro
Sulla, c. 20). Yet they said ‘negotia ha-
bere’ (Pro Cluentio, c. 69), which Forcel-
lini explains to mean ‘merchandize;' but
incorrectly I think. ‘Negotia' may have
the meaning of ‘merchandize' in the pas-
sage m Horace (Ep. i. 6. v. 33) :—

“ NelCibyraticQ ne Bithyna negotia per-
( as!

But it may also be explained as having the
ordinary meaning. Cicero (Ad Div. xii. 21)
has ⁴ ut—sua negotia conficiat,’ which means
⁴ settle his money affairs) ‘ Habet negotia
vetera in Sicilia' (Ad Div. xiii. 30). But
‘negotium gere1·e,' as Halm says, seems to
be the same as ⁴ negotiari,’ to be a ‘ nego-
tiator!

vadimoniis——pwosvripliouihus] See the
oration Pro P. Quintio, and the Index to
Vol. 11., ⁴Vadimonium, Judicium, Pro-
scriptio bonoru1n,’-‘infitiatores lentos?
he says ⁴ slow ‹leniers,’ or rather, as ‘infitia-
tores ' comes tirst, he means men who refuse
payment of their ‹lebts by excuses, by in-
venting reasons for ‹lelay (lentos). ‘ Infi-
tiator' is a common term to express a man
who denies a dobt, as in Dc Or. i. 37 ; and
in Juvenal, v. 60 :—

“ Nunc si depositum non infitietur ami-
n

cuS.

ne vicini quidem] Ilalm observes that
this is a proverbial kind of speech, as in
Lucian, Charon, c. 16: οὖτος-ἦν καὶ

πέσῃ, ἀψοφητὶ κείσεται, μόλις καὶ τοῖς
γείτοσιν ἐξακουσθέντος τοῦ πτώματος.

carcer] It is said there was only one
prison in Rome, a part of which, called
Tullianum, was used for executions. Len-
tulus and some of the other prisoners were
strangled in the Tullianum (Sallust, Cat.
c. 55).

de complexu] This is an expression used
to signify an intimate friend, a bosom friend,
as we say, probably following the Roman
turn (Cic. Ad Fam. xiV. 4 ; ⁶ in sinu semper
et complexu meo ') 3 but it is easy to see, as
Muretus observes, that Cicero has a foul
allusion, atter his fashion.-—-‘imberbes:'
these were youths who had no beards,
either because they were too young or too
effeminate. Manutius would read ‘paene
barbatos‚’ because Cicero says afterwards,
‘⁴ Hi pueri tam lepidi ac delicatisy The
heard was worn to the age of manhood, and
then cut. Though it was not the fashion in
Cicero’s time for older men at Rome to
wear beards, it seems that some of the
young dandies wore them. The old Romans
were heard-men. The story is that barbers
first came from Sicily, A.U.c. 451. Ρ. Sci-
pio Al'rivanus P. F. when lie was under
forty years of age used to shave him-
self: “Comperimus autem verm-os quoque
in iisdem temporibus nobiles viros barbam
in ejusmodi aetate rasitavisse: icen-coque
plerasque imagines veterum non admodum
senum, sed in medio aetatis ita factas vide-
mus ’' (Gellius, iii. 4).
