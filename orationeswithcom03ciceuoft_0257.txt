aut invidiae esse quaesitum. VI. Itaque hanc partem totam relin-
quam: tantum a vobis petam, judices, ut, si quid ipsi audistis com-
muni fama atque sermone de vi, de manu, de armis, de copiis, merni-
neritis quarum rerum invidia, lege hac recenti ac nova certus est
inquisitioni comitum numerus constitutus. Sed ut hanc vim omit-
tam, quanta illa sunt, quae quoniam accusatorio jure et more sunt
facta, reprehendere non possumus, queri tamen cogimur: primum
quod distributis partibus sermo est tota Asia dissipatus Cn.
Pompeium, quod L. Flacco est vehementer inimicus, contendisse a
D. Laelio, paterno amico ac pernecessario, ut hunc 1106 judicio
arcesseret3 omnemque ei suam auctoritatem, gratiam, copias, opes
ad hoc negotium conficiendum detulisse. Id hoc verisimilius Graecis
hominibus videbatur, quod paullo ante in eadem provincia familiarem
Laelium Flacco viderant. Pompeii autem auctoritas quum apud
omnes tanta est quanta esse debet, tum excellit in ista provincia
quam nuper et praedonum et regum bello liberavit. Adjunxit illa,

6. leqe hac] The Scholiast (Schol. Bob.)
supposes that Cicero refers to a Judiciaria
Lex proposed either by P. Vatinius tr. pl.
or by Q. Fufius Calenus: “Legem judicia-
riam viderur significare sive a P. Vatinio
tribuno plebis sive a Q. Fufio Caleno prae-
tore latam : pertinebat autem ad judicum re-
jectionem. Igitur ea lege praefinitum vide-
batur, quot numero comites habere debe-
rent, qui in provincias irent ut accusationem
de pecuniis repetundis instruerent. Nunc
ergo Laelium videri vult supergressum legis
istius praescripta inciviliter multa fecisse.”
This Lex Futia is mentioned by Dion Cas-
sius (38. c. 8), and the passage is explained
by Orelli (Index Legum, p. 178) correctly,
I think, as referring to a Judiciaria Lex,

Cicero tells the judices, if they have heard
of acts of violence committed in the pro-
vince by Laelius and his friends, when they
were collecting their evidence against Flac-
cus, to remember what those things were
which were so odious that a Lex was lately
passed to fix the number of persons who
might aceompany a prosecutor, when he was
collecting evidence in a province.

Baiter points it thus, ‘memineritisz qua-
rum rerum invidia.' Each nation has its
way of pointingg and I may not understand
Baiter's. If the passage were so pointed
here, a reader would misunderstand it.

hanc vim] Cicero assumes that violent
acts were done by Laelius. He will how-
erer pass over them, and mention other
things (illa).

distributispartibus] “ Each man having
his district in which he was to spread the

report‚'' that Cn. Pompeius urged Laelius
to prosecute Flaccus (judicio arcesseret).
The remark about the Greeks is a piece of
bitter satire: the Greeks believed this the
more readily, as they had lately seen Laelius
in the province on terms of great intimacy
with Flaccus. What more natural to a
Greek than for a man to attack his friend?
Manutius, who is not sharp at seeing a joke
or discovering humour, says on these words :
“ut ejus erimina propter familiaritatem
nosse potuerit ;’' but Cicero would not say
this or mean this. An enemy of Flaccus
might have said it.

est vehementer] ‘esset Β. et Huldricus‚
est ceteri ;’ and Baiter.

praedonum] Pompeius had received the
command 10 the war against the pirates by
a Lex of A. Gabinius, and the command in
the war against Mithridates by the Lex
Manilia (De Imper. Cn. Pompeii, Vol.

gldjunoez't illm] Laelius of course, but we
might expect that the name would have
been given. The ‘testimonii denuntiatio’
is the giving persons notice to appear as
witnesses. There are some rules on this
matter in the later Roman Law (Dig. 22.
tit. 5. De Testibus). The verb ‘denun-
tiare' is a term of art: “Lege Julia judi.
ciorum publicorum cavetur ne invito de—
nuntietur ut,” &c. Those who could not
stay at home were men who had no means
or 00 character, and they were carried to
Rome as witnesses with a liberal allowanco

is sent a long way has always a good appe--
