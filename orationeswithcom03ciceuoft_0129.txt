OAP. 12, 13. 115

tur, scripta sunt omnia; neque tamen quidquam tam anguste
scriptum est, quo ego non possim, QUA mc RE Afflrnn, addere.
Quae consuluntur autem minimo periculo respondentur. Si id
quod oportet responderis, idem videare respondisse quod Servius3
sin aliter, etiam controversum jus nosse et tractare videare. Qua-
propter non solum illa gloria militaris vestris formulis atque actioni-
bus anteponenda est, verum etiam dicendi consuetudo longe et
inultum isti vestrae exercitationi ad honorem antecellit. Itaque
mihi videntur plerique initio multo hoc 1113111155ος post, quum id
assequi non potuissent, istuc potissimum sunt delapsi. Ut aiunt
in Graecis artificibus, eos auloedos esse qui citharoedi fieri non
potuerint, sic nonnullos videmus, qui oratores evadere non potuerint,
eos ad juris studium devenire. Magnus dicendi labor, magna res,
magna dignitas, summa antem gratia. Etenim a vobis salubritas
quaedam3 ab iis qui dicunt salus ipsa petitur. Deinde vestra
responsa atque decreta et evertuntur saepe dicendo, et sine defen-
sione oratoris firma esse non possunt; in qua si satis profecissem,
parcius de ejus laude dicerem: nunc nihil de me dico, sed de iis qui
in dicendo magni sunt aut suerunt.

and he adds, “nothing is drawn up in such
concise terms to which Ι cannot add a Qua
de re agitur ;⁷’ one of the most usual Roman
legal expressions which Cicero is laughing
at. (Introduction to the oration Pro Caecina,
Vol. 11. ; and Cicero, Brutus, c. 79.)

Quae consuluntur] ‘⁶ But when a man
comes to ask my advice on a matter of law.’'
He has made two divisions of the juriscon-
sult’s business; one to supply the proper
⁴ formulae ’ for a trial ; the other to give his
advice On a legal question. If Cicero gives
a right opinion, he will be on the same side
as Servius; by saying which he intends to
pay Servius an indirect compliment. If he
should be wrong, he will be supposed to be
1 acquainted with the disputed points of law
and to have handled them. ln the oration
Pro Caecina, c. 24 (Vol. ΙΙ.) there is the
expression ‘jus varium!

antecellit] ‘M. antecellet, codd. rel.’
Ilalm. Moebius, who prefers ‘antecellet‚’
says: “The fut. instead of ‘antecellit,’ a
usual Ciceronian expression, which, as 111
Greek, contains also 3 delicate turn of 1110
categorical form which is purposely avoidcdst’

Ut aiunt—devenire] Quoted by Quin-
tilian, Inst. viii. 3. 79. In the first part of
this sentence some editions have ⁴ potne-
rint,’ and in the second place they have
‘ potuerunt! Both are Latin3 but the sense

1

is not quite the same. Thc difference be-
tween ‘evadere non potuerunt’ and 'eva-
dere non potuerint ' is the difference between
a direct negation (non potuerunt), which is
not intended, for there are 110 definite per-
sons to whom the negation will apply, and
a negation which expresses a possibility
(non potuerint), the possibility of their not
succeeding.

Cicero is right when he says that it is
easier to become a lawyer than an orator,
an orator as he understood oratory. A
lawyer requires only industry and good
sense. Any other quality is not wanted,
and is an impediment with some 111011.
Many of the best lawyers are slow, labori-
ous men, without taste, or imagination, or
passion3 but they have a sound judgment.
An orator requires more than a lawyer3
some natural gifts‚ a good voice, animation,
taste, and readiness. But hc must have 111-
dnstry too, knowledge and judgment, or he
will be merely an idle talker. Cicero him-
5011 10115 115 111 1115 Brutus what a laborious
study oratory was to him (c. !)l).—‘salns
ipsa:' see Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3. c. 57; and
Vol. ΙΙ. Pro Fonteio, c. 10.

in qua si satis] ⁴ qua' refers to ‘ defen-
sione,’ but in substance to the ‘facultas
dicendi!
