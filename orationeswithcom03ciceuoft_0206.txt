192 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

Pompeium de meis rebus gestis et de summa re publica misi, et ex
ea crimen aliquod in P. Sullam quaeris3 et si furorem incredibilem
biennio ante conceptum erupisse in meo consulatu scripsi, me hoc
demonstrasse dicis, Sullam in illa fuisse superiore conjuratione.
Scilicet ego is sum qui existimem Cn. Pisonem et Catilinam et·
Vargunteium et Autronium nihil scelerate, nihil audacter ipsos per
sese sine P. Sulla facere potuisse. De quo etiam si quis dubitasset
antea num, id quod tu arguis, cogitasset interfecto patre tuo consule
descendere Kalendis J anuariis cum lictoribus, sustulisti hanc suspi-
cionem quum dixisti hunc, ut Catilinam consulem efficeret, contra
patrem tuum operas et manum comparasse. Quod si tibi ego con-
fitear, tu mihi concedas necesse est hunc, quum Catilinae suffragare-
tur, nihil de suo consulatu, quem judicio amiserat, per vim recu-
perando cogitavisse : neque enim istorum facinorum tantorum, tam
atrocium crimen, judices, P. Sullae persona suscipit.

Jam enim faciam, criminibus omnibus fere dissolutis, contra atque
in ceteris caussis fieri solet, ut nunc denique de vita hominis ac de
moribus dicam. Etenim de principio studuit animus occurrere
magnitudini criminis, satisfacere exspectationi hominum, de me
aliquid ipso qui accusatus eram dicere ; nunc jam revocandi estis eo
quo vos ipsa. caussa, etiam tacente me, cogit animos mentesque

the oration Iu Cn. Plancium, c. 34). We
must infer that the letter was made puh-
lic, and probably by Cicero himself.

de summa re publica] The reading of
T. B. The rest have ‘ de summa rei publi-
cae) See Iu Cat. i. e. 6.

persona] We may here translate this
word ‘ character)

eontra atque] ¹ Contra ac ’ (Verr. ii. 4.
c. 6). Halm refers to the Auctor ad He-
renn. ii. 3. 5 : “ Defensor primum demon-
strabit. vitam integram, si poterit,’' διο.

De quo] ‘Quo’ of course refers to (See the Introd.) Halm observes that the

Sulla. The pointing of this sentence is
wrong in Orelli’s edition. Halm has it right3
and it is right iu some ot' the old edi—
tions.

descendere] ‘ In forum’ with his lictors,
as if he were consul (Manutius); so, he
sayS, they used to speak, for the nobles
came down from their houses in the high
parts of the city to the Forum. Cicero
says in another place ⁴ mc . . . Cum fascibus
descensurum ;’ and ‘eum sacra via descen-
derem.’ Cicero's argument is this: “If
Sulla conspired against Torquatus in order
to assume the consular authority on the
first of January, it is not likely that after his
convictiou for bribery hc got together work-
ing men (⁴ operae ⁵) and a band in order to
secure Catiliua’s election by v0t‹·s.²’

operas] The word is often used Γοι-
⁴ operarii‚' workmen. hired people, us ‘ser-
vitia ' iu the plural sor ‘servi.'

Greek orators generally put in the last place
the ¹ probabile ex vita 3' and that the ⁴ pro-
babile ex vita ’ is so placed in this oration,
because Cicero must have certainly felt that
Sulla was not yet suffieiently cleared bytho
⁴ dissolutio eriminum.’ This and many like
remarks which occur in modern erities show
a great want of practical knowledge. Sulla's
guilt was to be established by evidence.
&Vc do not know what the evidence was.
Cicero says there was no evidence that
came before him as consul of Sulla's being
implieated in the second conspiracy; and
Hortensius had answered about the tirst
conspiracy. We. cannot contradict Cicero,
for we know no more about Sulla than ap-
pears in this oration and in the few other
noliees iu the aiu-ient writers. He was at·-
quitted too, and though an acquittal is not
a proof of innovenee, it is a fact on which
we cannot found a presumptiou of guilt.
