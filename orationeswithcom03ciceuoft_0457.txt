qni statas] There is a passage in Valerius
Maximus (i. 1) quoted by Markland, which
bears some resemblance to this ε “ Majores
nostri statas solemnesque caerimonias Pon-
tificum scientia3 bene gerendarum rerum
auctoritates augurum observatione; Apol-
linis praedictiones, vatum libris; porten-
torum depulsa Etrusca disciplina explicari
voluerunt.’' But it is better said in Vale-
rius, and if one copied the other, it is the
Declamator who copied, Markland finds
fault with ‘ Pontificatus ' being used to sig-
nify ‘Pontificum scientia.’ Gesner says
that ⁴ Pontificatus ’ means the ‘munus ponti-
ficis,’ but it seems that the author did not
take it so. “ It must not be assumed that
our orator's expressions are not Latin.
Gesner has maintained them with perfect
right against Markland, and Wolf could
only sneer'’ (Klotz).——‘ explanationes :¹ ¹ ex-
piationes,' Sigonius, Baiter.

Deinde etiam coynovz']
habui otii, etiam eognovi’ (Baiter).
MSS. reading is not ¹ si quid habui otii,’
but ⁴ si quid habui tolli,’ and ‘si quid ha-
buit tolli.’' M. omits this.

This sentence down to ‘ retentum’ may
deceive the reader. The ‘purpureus pan-
nus' which begins ‘Etenim quis est tam
vecors' has a specious look. It is worth
while seeing what it means.—-“ Ι have also
learned that many most learned men have
spoken and written about the gods3 and
though what they have written is written
¹ divinitus ’ (a word which this writer hardly
understands), it is of such kind that we
must conclude that our ancestors taught
them, and did not learn from tliem.”-One

would suppose that he intends to allude to
the writings of the Greeks, for what else is
there that he can allude to ? And he tells
us that all this philosophy came from the
Romans3 which is exactly contradictory of
what Cicero says every where else; and a
most ridiculous falsehood. Cicero says (Ad
Q. Fr. i. l. c. 9), speaking of the Asiatic
Greeks: “Quum vero ei generi hominum

praesimus, non modo in quo ipsa sit sed
etiam a quo ad alios pervenisse videtur
humanitas, certe iis eam potissimum tri-
buere debemus a quibus accepiinus.’' He
continues z ⁴‘ For who is so stupid, either if
he has raised his eyes to the heavens, as
not to feel that there are gods—or, if he has
seen that there are gods, not to see that
this great empire is their work?'’ The two
‘auts' are important—⁴⁴ If a man raises
his eyes to heaven, he must be stupid, if he
cannot see there the evidence of divine
power.³'—We ean let that pass—‘⁴ Or, who
is so stupid if he believes in the gods as not
to see that Rome is their work ?’'—-We may
let this pass, and what then? Why, the
undisputed fact, the fact which every man
except a fool admits, that Rome is the
work of the gods, and this proves that the
Romans taught the philosophers. I do not
admit that the writer had the least idea
that he was talking this nonsense; but like
many others he writes one thing and sup-
poses that he is writing another.

The next sentence is that for which the
whole of this grand preparation was made.

Italians themselves (Itali ipsi) and Latins.
all severally excel the Romans in their
several arts, but ‘⁴ in piety and religion and
in this one knowledge that we have dis—
covered every thing to be directed and go-
verned by the divinity ot the immortal gods,
we have surpassed all races and nations.''
This superiority must have been only in
degree, I suppose, for other nations had
some piety and some religion. As to the
discovery of the divine government of the
world, Ι do not know whether he means
that other nations were absolutely ignorant
of it, or that the Romans “ sui-passed them
in the knowledge of it, of the fact.'’
Or we may take this another way, for the
writer presents us with many handle< to lay
hold of. He says in substance that a man
is a fool who, looking up to heaven, does
not see that there are immortal gods3 or
