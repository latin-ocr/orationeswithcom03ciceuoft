316 ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

publica apud eos solum, qui ejus vocem exaudire possent, eadem
voce senatus omnes ex omnibus agris atque oppidis cives totamque
Italiam ad unius salutem defendendam excitaret? X. Quid ego
gloriosius meis posteris potui relinquere quam hoc senatum judicasse,
qui civis me 11011 defendisset, eum rem publicam salvam noluisse?
Itaque tantum vestra auctoritas, tantum eximia consulis dignitas
valuit, ut dedecus et flagitium se committere putaret, si qui 11011
veniret. idemque consul, quum illa incredibilis multitudo Romam
et paene Italia ipsa venisset, vos frequentissimos in Capitolium
convocavit. Quo tempore quantam vim naturae bonitas haberet
et vera nobilitas intelligere potuistis. Nam Q. Metellus, et inimicus
et frater inimici, perspecta vestra voluntate omnia privata odia
deposuit : quem P. Servilius, vir quum clarissimus tum vero optimus
mihique amicissimus, et auctoritatis et orationis suae divina quadam
gravitate ad sui generis communisque sanguinis facta virtutesque
revocavit, ut haberet- in consilio et fratrem ab inferis, socium rerum
mearum, et omnes Metellos praestantissimos cives paene ex
Acheronte excitatos, in quibus Numidicum illum, cujus quondam
de patria discessus molestus omnibus, ipsi ne luctuosus quidem
visus est. Itaque exstitit non modo salutis defensor, qui ante hoc
unum beneficium fuerat inimicus, verum etiam ascriptor dignitatis

passage therefore can hardly be urged as
evidence against the genuineness of this
speech.

10. Q „Metellusfl Nepos, who was con-
sul with Lentulus (Pro Sestio, c. 33). Ne-
pos is called the brother of Clodius; but
he was his ‘consobrinus' P. Servilius
is Isauricus, who brought about the re-
conciliation between Cicero and Metellus
Nepos (Pro Sestio, c. 62; In Pison. c. 15).
Servilius was the son of a daughter of Q.
Metellus Macedonicus, and therefore re-
lated to the Metelli (communis sanguinis).

fratrem ab ivqferisfl Celer, who was
dead. He was praetor in Cicero’s consul—
ship (socium rerum mearum). This pas-
sage must be compared with the passage in
the oration Pro 805110, 0. 62, of which this
is a caricature. But what are we to say to
‘ex Acheronte excitatos,’ and ‘paene ex
Acheronte excitatos?' VVere they to be
roused up from the banks of Acheron, or
to be almost roused up, or what does he
mean ἓ And what shall we say to the way
in which Metellus Numidicus is introduced,
and the flatness and insipidity of the words
‘ cujus quondam . . . visus est ?’ lfa man
wished to say something that was not to the
purpose, he could not do it better. The

expression in the speech Pro Sestio, c. 62,
15 111 a different style: “quumque eum
(Servilius) ad domestici exempli memoriam
et ad Numidici illius casum vel gloriosum
vel gravem convertisset.”

other reading is ‘dimittit' or ‘dimittitur‚'
in which there is no sense.-‘ is qui sua lege:'
Clodius. See c. 2.

ascriptor] He says (c. 4) “quum in
restituendo auctorem fuisse ascriptoremque
videatis.'' “When a S. C. was drawn up,
the names ofthose who were in favour of
it were added3 and these senators used to
be present when it was drawn up ’' (Hot-
mann). Whether the names of all ‘ quorum
de sententia factum fuerat ’ were ⁴ adscripta‚'
I do not know. It was usual for certain
senators ‘ adesse honoris causa‚’ and to add
their nameS. Klotz refers to the De Lege
Agraria, ii. 9, where the expression ‘ad-
scriptores legis agrariae’ occurs3 and he
affirms that such an ‘adscriptor ’ wrote his
name under a Lex when it was promulgated.
This may be s03 but if there is no further
evidence than what he gives, he has not
proved it. However, the Declamator means
that as the ‘ascriptor' of his ‘dignitas’
he was in favour of Cicero’s recall and of
