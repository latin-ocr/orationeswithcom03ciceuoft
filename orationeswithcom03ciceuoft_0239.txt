POETA OAP. 9, 10. 225

etiam in sepulcro Scipionum putatur is esse constitutus ex mar-
At iis laudibus certe non solum ipse qui laudatur, sed etiam
populi Romani nomen ornatur. In caelum hujus proavus Cato toln
litur3 magnus honos populi Romani rebus adjungitur. Omnes
denique illi Maximi, Marcelli, Fulvii non sine communi omnium
nostrum laude decorantur. X. Ergo illum, qui haec fecerat, Rudi-
num hominem‚ majores nostri in civitatem receperunt: nos hunc
Heracleensem, multis civitatibus expetitum, in hac autem legibus
constitutum, de nostra civitate ejiciemus?

Nam si quis minorem gloriae fructum putat ex Graecis versibus
percipi quam ex Latinis, vehementer errat; propterea quod Graeca
leguntur in omnibus fere gentibus, Latina suis finibus exiguis sane
continentur. Quare si res eae quas gessimus orbis terrae regioni-
bus definiuntur, cupere debemus quo manuum nostrarum tela per-
venerint, eodem gloriam famamque penetrare, quod quum ipsis
populis, de quorum rebus scribitur, haec ampla sunt, tum iis certe,
qui de vita gloriae caussa dimicant, hoc maximum et periculorum

more.

the monument of the Scipiones outside the
Porta Capena, one of which statues was
supposed to represent Ennius. The tomb
of the Scipios was discovered in 1780 ; and
there is the work of Visconti on it (Opere
varie, Vol. I. Milano, 1827).

At iis] The transition, says Halm, is
very abrupt. Accordingly Garatoni sup-
poses that something has been lost, or at
least he would read ‘At ejus annalibus!
Pantagathus proposed ‘At ejus laudibus!
The words ‘iis laudibus ' must be referred
to the sentence, ⁴ Quae quorum ingeniis.'

hujus] We may suppose Cato Uticensis
to have been present when his great grand-
father the Censor was mentioned, or Cicero
chooscs to make it appear so. Cicero has
the usual enumeration of great Roman
names: Fabius who baffled Hannibal3 Mar-
cellus who took Syracuse3 and the Fulvii,
Quintus who distinguished himself in the
Second Punic war, and M. Fulvius No-
bilior, consul B.c. 183, who subjugated
Aetolia. The son of Nobilior, himself a
man of letters, procured the Roman civitas
for Ennius: “Q. Nobiliorem M. F. jam
patrio instituto deditum studio litterarum,
qui etiam Q. Ennium quicum patre ejus in
Aetolia militaverat, civitate donavit, quum
triumvir coloniam deduxisset.”

10. Nam] Halm proposes a question as
usual, What is the thought to bc supplied
by which the transition is effected? Our

word ‘Now’ seems to express the thing.
The orator meets an objection not made,
but implied, that Ennius wrote in Latin,
Archias in Greek. Cicero often uses this
form: ‘Nam quid ego de studiiss διο. (De
Am. 6. 27); De Officiis, iii. 6: ‘ Nam illud
quidem absurdum 3’ Verr. ii. l. c. 34:
‘ Nam quid Milesiis 3’ and Verr. ii. 2. c. 66.
‘ Nam ’ often introduces something on which
there is no intention to dwell.

eoeiqm's] So it was even in Cicero's
time. Rome had not yet many colonies
out of Italy3 but in one century more the
Latin language was widely spread, and the
works of the younger Pliny could be had in
the shops of Lugdunum (Pliny, Ep. ix. ll).
Plutarch says of his time: ὼς δοκεῖ μοι
περὶ Ῥωμαίων λέγειν, ὧν μὲν λόγῳ νῦν
ὁμοῦ τι πάντες ἅνθρωποι χρῶνται (Plato-
nicae Quaestiones, x. 3, Vol. V. ed. Wyt-
tenbach).

tle vila qloriae caussa] Here we have
again Cicero’s glory (Vol. ΙΙ. Pro C. Ra-
birio, c. 10, note on Gloria). The Romans
of the heroic time fought as a duty. Cicero’s
glory is the soldier’s glory whom Shakspere
represents as

seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth.”

with him, but some of them were soldiers
too. Aristobulus and Ptolemaeus arc the
