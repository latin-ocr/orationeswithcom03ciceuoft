226 ORAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

suarum magnus ille Alexander secum habuisse dicitur. Atque is
tamen, quum in Sigeo ad Achillis tumulum astitisset, O fortunate,
inquit, adolescens qui tuae virtutis Homerum praeconem inveneris.
Et vere: nam, nisi Ilias illa exstitisset, idem tumulus qui corpus ejus
contexerat nomen etiam obruisset. Quid, noster hic Magnus, qui
cum virtute fortunam adaequavit, nonne Theophanem Mitylenaeum
scriptorem rerum suarum in contione militum civitate donavit3 et
nostri illi fortes viri, sed rustici ac milites, dulcedine quadam gloriae
commoti, quasi participes ejusdem laudis, magno illud clamore ap-
probaverunt? Itaque, credo, si civis Romanus Archias legibus non
esset, ut ab aliquo imperatore civitate donaretur perficere non
potuit. Sulla, quum Hispanos et Gallos donaret, credo, hunc pe—
tentem repudiasset; quem nos in contione vidimus, quum ei libel·
lum malus poeta de populo subjecisset, quod epigramma in eum
fecisset tantummodo alternis versibus longiusculis, statim ex iis

authorities on which Arrian has written
his Anabasis (Arrian's Introduction to his

Populus Romanus sometimes allowed those
who were ⁴ triumviri ² for the establishment

Anabasis).

Tradition gave the name of Achilles to
one of the barrows on the plain of Troy
near Sigeum3 either because the memory
of the great Thessalian hero had been pre-
served in popular story, or because the
Iliad gave immortality to his name. Arrian
(Anab. i. 12): Oi δὲ ὅτι καὶ τὸνἈχιλλέως
ἄρα τάφον ἐστεφάνωσε. Ἡφαιστίωνα δὲ
λέγουσιν, ὅτι τοῦ Πατρόκλου τόν τάφον
ἐστεφάνωσε, καὶ εὐδαιμόνισεν ἄρα, ὡς ὁ
λόγος, Ἀλέξανδρος Ἀχιλλέα, ὅτι Ὀμήρου
κήρυκος ἐς τήν ἔπειτα μνήμην ἔτυχε.

hic Maqnus,] Halm's remark is just,
that we cannot conclude from the word
‘hic’ that Magnus was present. Cicero⁷s
fiattery of this man is very disgusting. He
mentions him next to Alexander. Pom-
peius was a soldier and a man of ability, but
men do not expect in their lifetime to bc
compared with the greatest men of past
days. Theophanes, Pompeius' flattcrer,
was a native of Mitylene in Lesbos. Strabo
(xiii. p. 617) 1135 something about him and
1115 intimacy with Pompeius: he calls him
ὁ συγγραφεύς. “ On arriving at Mitylene
Pompeius gave the city its frecdom for the
sake of Theophanes '¹ (Plutarch, Pompeius,
e. 42). Many instances are mentioned of
the civitas being given by commanders.
Perhaps 1115 practice was irregular at first.
It seems 10 115 to be a great assumption to
give the civitas. Ennius, as already ob-
served, received the civitas by the favour of
Q. Fulvius Nobilior; and it is said that the

of a Roman colony to give the civitas to
Peregrini (Pro Balbo, c. 21). Great men
like Pompeius perhaps gave it sometimes
without permission.

Hispanos] Cicero (Pro Balbo, c. 22)
mentions Aristo of Massilia and some men
of Gades as having received the civitas from
Sulla.

subjeeisset‚] The poor poet passed up
(subjecit) to Sulla as he was seated on his
tribunal the miserable hexameters and pen-
tameters (alternis versibus) which he had
made. The tyrant had taste and humour.
He liked not the verses, and he paid the
poet to write no more. Sulla selling the
property of the murdered Romans and pay-
ing the poet out of the sale money, is a
picture of Rome’s degradation and the
man’s contempt for those whom he had
t-amed (Plutarch, Sulla, c. 33): “ The sales
of confiscated property were conducted by
him from his tribunal in such an arrogant
and tyrannical manner, that his mode of
dealing with the produce of the sales was
more intolerable than the seizure of the
property3 he gave away to handsome wo-
men, players 011 the lyre, ‘mimi‚' and
worthless ‘libertini‚' the lands of whole
nations and 1115 revenues oscitics.'' Appian
(B. C. i. 101) has recorded something that
Sulla said to the people when they were
grumbling. lt was a warning to keep quiet.
Modern tyrauny does not do the thing so
impudently; bnt still it does it.
