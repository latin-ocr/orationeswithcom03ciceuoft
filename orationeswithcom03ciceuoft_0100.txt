ORAT. IV. IN L. CATILINAM

tantam conspirationem bonorum omnium confringere et labefactare

possit.

rebus obsequemur, funditus eos perire
patiemur (the provinciales) quorum non
modo saluti sed etiam commodis consu-
lere debemus. Haec est una, si vere co-
gitare volumus, in toto imperio tuo difficul-
tas.⁷’

The power of the money-men in the
Roman state at this time is a lesson and a
warning. The poets and the satirists re-
present the Roman of the later republican
and of the carly imperial period as greedy
after money, and either a miser or a prodi-
gal voluptuary. This is not an imaginary
picture. The vice of greediness was deep
seated in the Italians of that day. In every
country into which the Roman arms had
penetrated, and even where they had not,
the ⁴ mercator ' came with his wares to drive
a profitable bargain with the natives. He
followed the Roman camp to purchase the
slaves taken in war; and sometimes he lost
his life while he was looking after money.
In 311 the provinces which were settled
peaceably the negotiator fixed himself: he
was the banker‚ the money-changer, the
money-lender‚ the merchant who bought
up corn and wool. He placed his own
capital and the capital of those who would
trust it to him. The patriot Brutus, or
some good friend of his, placed his money
out for him at exorbitant interest. The
provinces swarmed with these money-mak-
ing men. Closely allied to the ‘negotia-
tores' were the Publicani, Roman equites
who formed companies or associations for
farming of the taxes 111 the provinces. They
advanced money for the use of the govern-
ment; and they and the ⁴ negotiatores ’ had
in their hands the whole money market.
Public credit depended on their operations
and the remittances from the provinces, for
Rome and Italy consumed what the pro-
vinces produced. The Senate, which had
the administration of affairs, could not
carry on 1118 government without the aid of
those who had the money3 and the governor
of 3 province, who wished to have a quiet
time, and escape 311 danger of prosecution
after he left the province, must wink at the
oppression of the sarmers-general3 and if
he would not join them in the plunder, he
must at least not disturb them in their ra-
pacious exactions.

Cicero in this and other passages de-
scribes prccisely the condition of modern
states, where the great 11135585 of money
accumulated in a few hands make an order
in the statc; an order which has no object

except the profitable employment of capital
and the increase of its own wealth3 an order
which cares neither for liberty, nor honour,
nor knowledge, except so far as knowledge
may increase riches; an order which regu-
13185 peace and war, and will lend money
evcn to the enemies of their country if
profit can be made by the loan. The rich
who are not governed by the love of gain
are few; and the exceptions are the more
honourable as the love of money is the
strongest of human passionSL When this
passion is well fixed, it destroys 311 others,
and every noble feeling3 love, tenderness,
mercy, humanity are swallowed up in
this bottomless abyss. Selfishness, hard-
ness of heart, pride, and cruelty sit by the
side of the love of gain, always ready to
obey the orders of the infernal spirit en-
throned within the wall of flesh. The wise
man said well that the love of money is the
root of all evil. The pai-able of the sower
(Matthew‚ xiii.; Lul<e‚viii.) who went forth
to sow contains all that can be said about
the love of money. It is rich in instruction,
as rich and abundant as the commentaries
on it are meagre and barren. The com-
mentators have not darcd to handle it. A
man will not touch that which bul-ns his
fingers.

The great advantage that society derives
from the accumulation of capital for the
production of more wealth is so clear, that
the economists need not try to prove it, and
they may spare their laudations on a matter
that no man who opens his eyes can deny.
The capitalist adds to his wealth by the
prudent employment of his capital, and
others derivc advantage from it too.. But
as it is in all things, what we call good and
what we call bad are mingled together ; and
though the accumulation of wealth in mo-
dern times has created a prodigious power,
which is fclt all over the world, it contains
within it the seed of corruption, the decay
of morals, the debasement of mankind, and
1118 ruin of liberty rightly understood. As
it was in Rome, so it is nOW.

corwpirationem] This Roman noun,whieh
we have brought into our language‚ means
simple ⁴ consent ' or ⁴ common opinion ς’ as
Cicero says ‘conspiratio consensusque vir-
tutum.' But it is also used to express
union for a bad purpose, as in the oration
Pro Deiotaro, c. 4 : ⁵< Nihil de conspiratione
audiebat certorum hominum contra digni-
tatem tuam.”-—‘confringere? there is a
reading ‘ perfringere)
