ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

vere objicitur, vehementis accusatoris; sin falso, maledici convicia-

toris.

Quare quum ista sis auctoritate, non debes, M. Cato, arri-

pere maledictum ex trivio aut ex scurrarum aliquo convicio, neque
temere consulem populi Romani saltatorem vocare, sed circumspi-
cere quibus praeterea vitiis affectum esse necesse sit eum, eui vere

istud objici possit.

Nemo enim fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte in-

sanit, neque in solitudine, neque in convivio moderato atque

honesto.

decent. Macrobius says (ii. 10): “Taceo
quod matronae etiam saltationem non in-
honestam putabant, sed inter probas quoque
earum erat saltandi cura, dummodo non
curiosa usque ad artis perfectionem: quid
enim ait Sallustius: ⁴ PsaHere, saltare ele-
gantius quam necesse est p1·obae:’ adeo et
ipse Semproniam reprehendit, non quod
saltare, sed quod optime scierit.'' The Ro-
mans danced, but the dance was decent. We
dance too; but if a woman danced in so-
ciety like an opera dancer on the stage, we
should set her down as an indecent woman,
and the company as no better. There is a
curicus passage in Macrobius (ii. 10) about
dancing‚ from a speech of Scipio Africanus
Aemilianus, which he found the means of
introducing where we should not expect it,
in a speech against the Lex Judiciaria of
Ti. Gracchus. The Greeks and Romans
had immodcst dances. The Spanish women
excelled in this, the women from Gades
(Cadiz), who still practise it. (Juvenal,
xi. 162.)—⁴ M. Cato? ‘ Marce,' Halm.

εχ trivio] Picked up from the streets,
where many a coarse joke and much abuse
was heard. The Italians had a taient in
this way. There is a reading ‘aliquo con-
vivio,’ but I do not know what authority
there is for it. Halm writes ⁴convitium,’
on which there are some remarks in For-
cellini (v. Convicium).

There is a note on ‘scurra’ in Vol. II.
Pro P. Quintio, e. 3. Schmid (Horace,
Ep. i. 15. 28) says “these ‘scurrae' seem
to have been originally poorer Roman citi-
zens without landed property, who attached
themselves to the rich to live upon them.''
Men without any thing we may suppose3
but men perhaps of some little education,
idle fellows, mean enough to do any thing
rather than work. Horace's proscribed
Rupilius Rex (Sat. i. 7) may be a sample of
one; and he introduces another by name,
Sarmentus (Sat. i. 5), who amuses the
polite company. He helped to make the
supper go off well. Even Horace was
pleased. Any thing will plcase a good-

humoured man when he is travelling and
wants amusement:

‘⁴ Prorsus jucunde caenam produximus
illam.'’ (Horace, Sat. i. ὅ. ν. 70.)

the reading of two MSS. only. The other
reading is ‘ conspicere.5

Tempestivi conz›ivii,] Pro Archia, c. 6:
“ quantum alii tribuunt tempestivis con-
viviis, quantum denique aleae‚⁷' διο. 111 this
passage there is also the reading ‘intem-
pestivi.’ As ‘ tempestivus ’ contains the
element ‘time,' it is obvious that the word
may be used loosely. ⁴ Tempestivus ’ some-
times means that the thing spoken of is at
the time or season which is the right time;
as in the oration De Imperio Cn. Pomp. e.
12: “ nondum tempestivo ad navigandum
marist Cato (De Seu. c. 14) is made to
say: ‘⁴ Ego vero propter sermonis delecta-
tionem tempestivis quoque conviviis delector,
nec cum aequalibus solum, sed cum vestra
etiam aetate.’' If we read the preceding
chapter we infer that old Cato could even
take pleasure in a prolonged banquet for
the sake of the talk. The use os this word
shows that it means a prolonged feast, which
of course is intemperate, for people do not
sit at table and do nothing. They eat and
drink, and they can go on drinking long
after they have done eating. It was a feast
that began before the usual time, and not
for the purpose of being ended the sooner.
(Comp. Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3. c. 25.) So Ju-
venal says (i. 49):—

⁴¹ Exul⁷ ab octava Marius bibit, et fruitur
Iraiisiss'

This was a ⁴ tempestiva caena.’ Salmasius
(Florianus, by Flavius Vopiscus, p. 424)
has, as usual, a note overflowing with learn-
ing on ‘tempestiva convivia! He says:
“Atqui nunc doceo intempestiva convivia
nulla extare in veterum libris, nisi vitio
librariorum 3 ubicunque enim mentio fit in-
tempestivorum, eam intempestive fieri pn-
