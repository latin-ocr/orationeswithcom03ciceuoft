340 ORAT. QUUM POPULO GRATIAS EGIT

hominem homini debere vix fas est. Hujus consilia, P. Lentuli
sententiam, senatus anctoritatem vos secuti in eo me loco in quo
vestris beneficiis fueram, iisdem centuriis quibus collocaratis re-
posuistis. Eodem tempore audistis eodem ex loco summos viros,
ornatissimos atque amplissimos homines, principes civitatis, omnes
consulares, omnes praetorios eadem dicere, ut omnium testimonio
per me unum rem publicam conservatam esse constaret. Itaque
quum P. Servilius, gravissimus vir et ornatissimus civis, dixisset
opera mea rem publicam incolumem magistratibus deinceps tradi-
tam, dixerunt in eandem sententiam ceteri. Sed audistis eo tempore
clarissimi viri non solum auctoritatem, sed etiam testimonium, L.
Gellii: qui, quia suam classem attentatam magno cum suo periculo
paene sensit, dixit in contione vestra : Si ego consul quum fui non
fuissem, rem publicam funditus interituram fuisse.

VIII. En ego tot testimoniis, Quirites, hac auctoritate senatus,
tanta consensione Italiae, tanto studio bonorum omnium, agente
P. Lentulo, consentientibus ceteris magistratibus, deprecante Cn.
Pompeio, omnibus hominibus faventibus, diis denique immortalibus
frugum ubertate, copia, vilitate reditum meum comprobantibus,
mihi, meis, rei publicae restitutus, tantum vobis quantum facere
possum, Quirites, pollicebor: primum, qua sanctissimi homines
pietate erga deos immortales esse soleant, eadem 1110 erga populum

Servius Tullius were called to the vote.
But this cannot be accepted, particularly if
the allusion is to the vote at the Comitia

iisdem centuriis] By the votes of the
Comitia Centuriata.

Itaque quum P. Servilius‚] And what

accordingly, consequently (itaque) says this
‘gravissimus vir ?¹ Just the same as the
“summi viri, ornatissimi atque amplissimi
homines, principes civitatis, omnes consu-
lares, omnes praetorii.'' And what next
after he has said it? Why, the ‘ceteri'
say the same. Does any man suppose that
Cicero ever wrote in this way; that he
could write this way ? What says L. Gel-
lius? You heard not only his ‘ auctoritasss
but his ‘testimonium.' And what was his
⁴ testimonium ?' Exactly what every body
had said and every body kneW‚ as the genu-
ine Cicero would have us believe. Gellius
‘paene sensit‚’ he almost saw or almost
felt or almost knew some way that his
‘classis’ was assailed to his great danger.
If he had been quite sure. his ‘testimo-
nium' would have been stronger. His
‘ classis,' says Manutius, is the ⁴ classis ' of
which he was ‘custos ' at the voting; for
at the Centuriata Comitia the classes in
which the ‘populus’ was distributed by king

by which Cicero was recalled.

Ferratius conjectures that Gellius com-
manded a 110οε during the first conspiracy
of Catilina (Sallust, Cat. c. 14), when Cn.
Pompeius was condueting the war against
the pirates3 for Gellius at that time was in
command of a fleet as legatus of Pompeius
in the Tuscan sea: ‘¹ Gellius Tusco mari
impositus'' (Florus, iii. 6, 8). The con-
spirators, he supposes, attempted to corrupt
the fleet3 and L. Gellius ‘ paene sensit.’

vestra .- Sz] ed. Crat„ ‘vestrum si' codd.
Halm points it thus : ‘ vestrum si ego con-
sul,' &c.‚ with this remark: “Vis argutae
sententiae videtur; nisi ego, cum consul fui,
vobis consuluissem.’¹ A very ⁴ arguta senten-
tia ’ indeed: rather a miserable play on words.

8. Εη eqo tot] “ ‘ His ego' scripsi’'
(Halm). All the MSS. which he mentions
have ’,Ε11 eg0,' 01· ¹ Ε11 ego tot.’ The text
is probably corrupt.
