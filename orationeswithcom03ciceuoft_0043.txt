OAP. 9—11. 29

amentiam natura peperit, voluntas exercuit, fortuna servavit.
Numquam tu non modo otium, sed ne bellum quidem nisi nefarium
concupisti. Nactus es ex perditis atque ab omni non modo fortuna
verum etiam spe derelictis conflatam improborum manum. Hic tu
qua laetitia perfruere, quibus gaudiis exsultabis quanta in volup-
tate bacchabere, quum in tanto numero tuorum neque audies
virum bouum quemquam neque videbis? Ad hujus vitae studium
meditati illi sunt qui feruntur labores tui: jacere humi non solum
(ν ad obsit-lendum stup—rum verum etiam ad facinus obeundum: vigilare
n'on solum insidiantem somno maritorum, verum etiam bonis otioso-
rum. Habes ubi ostentes tuam illam praeclaram patientiam ianus,
frigoris, inopiae rerum omnium, quibus te brevi tempore confectum
esse senties. Tantum profeci tum quum te a consulatu reppuli, ut
exsul potius tentare quam consul vexare rem publicam posses3
atque ut id, quod est abs te scelerate susceptum, latrocinium potius
quam bellum nominaretur.
XI. Nunc, ut a 1110, patres conscripti, quandam prope justam
patriae querimoniam detester ac deprecer, percipite, quaeso, diligen-

10. λἀεἰηε· es] ‘ Nanctus es‚⁷ Halm, on the
authority of one MS. It is probable that
both forms were in use, ‘ nanc ’ and ⁴ nac ’
being the same root, and ‘ nanc ’ the
stronger form: as there is the root ‘ plag,'
‘ to strike,’ and ‘ plang ’ and ‘planc.’—
‘derelictis :’ this compound has a stronger
meaning than ‘ relietus.’ Caesar (B. G. iii.
13) has ‘ab aestu derelictae (naves),' ac-
cording to some readings, but the common
reading there is ‘ relictae.' Cicero (In Cat.
i. 8, has used the word ¹ demigrasti.' There
is a note in Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 2, c. 36, on
⁴ migrare ¹ and ‘emigrare.''

illi quifernntzcr——tui :] ‘ That discipline
of yours which is talkcd about.' Sallust
(Cat. c. 5) speaks of Catilina's endurance.
Catilina in his youth committed many ‘ ne-
fanda stupra ' (Cat. 15), 35 Sallust says.
‘ Stuprum ' is the eommerce of a man with
an unmarried woman, ⁴ virginem viduamve '
(Papinianus, Dig. 48, 5, 6) 3 but it had also
a more general signification. Cicero repre-
sents the man as lying on the ground to
watch an opportunity of committing some
foul act. ‘Meditari ' means bercto ⁴ practisc.'

otiosorum] The reading ‘occisorum’ ean
hardly be explained. who are the ‘ oet-isi ?'
Gruter, who knew that there was a reading
‘ otiosorum‚’ says “quod examinabunt otio-
siores mes* The ‘otiosi ' are those who are
off their guard; those who love quiet, and
live in quiet—⁴ reppuli :' there 15 good

authority sor this form, and for ‘repuli'
also, but the quantity of the first syllable
and the form of the perfect show that ‘ rep-
puli' is the genuine word. Cicero is al-
luding to the bold face which he presented
to Catilina at the consular Comitia of this
year (13.c. 63) when Silanus and Murena
were elected. Some commentators suppose
that Cicero alludes to his own election in
Β.0. 64ς but Ι think not.

est—susceptum,] There is also the read-
ing ‘esset-susceptum? Which must we
have? Halm asks, ‘⁴ How the common
reading ‘esset—susceptum ' differs from
that in the text, which is taken from some
of the best MSS. ?” The reader may answer
the question. It is not difficult.

ll. Nune, ul] Halm remarks that this
justificatior] of himself before the Patria
bears the marks of cool reflection and care-
ful calculation, and we cannot therefore
suppose that Cicero uttered it in a speech,
which in other respects has completely the
character of an extemporary diseourse. This
dialogue with the Patria certainly has not
the character ot* an extempore speech. lt
is a rhetorical ornament probably addi-d by
thc consul when he prepared this speech
for publication.

detester] This word is ‘testari' with
some additional encre-y put in it by the
prefixing 1111111Δ prepmition ‘ de.’ In Plau-
tus it is used in the seme of ‘testari deos.'
