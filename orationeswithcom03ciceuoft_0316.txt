302 ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

optimo viro? quem habuit ille pestifer annus et maxime fidelem, et
minime timidum, si dimicare placuisset, defensorem salutis meae.
Posteaquam vobis potestas decernendi non est permissa per eum
tribunum plebis, qui, quum per se rem publicam lacerare non
posset, sub alieno scelere delevit, numquam de me siluistis, num-
quam meam salutem non ab iis consulibus qui vendiderant flagita-
vistis. Itaque vestro studio atque auctoritate perfectum est ut ipse
ille annus, quem ego mihi quam patriae malueram esse fatalem,
octo tribunos haberet, qui et promulgarent de salute mea et ad vos
saepenumero referrent. Nam consules modesti legumque metuentes
impediebantur lege, non ea quae de me, sed ea quae de ipsis lata erat,
quam meus inimicus promulgavit, ut si revixissent ii qui haec paene
delerunt, tum ego redirem: quo facto utrumque confessus est, et
se illorum vitam desiderare, et magno in periculo rem publicam
futuram, si quum hostes atque interfectores rei publicae revixissent,

the man who is mentioned in the oration
Pro Cluentio, c. 26, and the writer seems
here to allude to his scandalous conduct as
a judex. He opposed the proposal of
Ninnius (Pro Sestio, c. 31) at the instiga-
tion of Clodius (sub alieno scelere); but
these words have been explained differently.
It is usual for this writer to leave usin
doubt about his meaning.

qui vendideram] ‘qui rem p. vendide-
rant,' Ε. F. He means ‘qui vendiderant
salutemz' they had sold Cicero to Clodius
for their provinces. Piso had Macedonia
and Gabinius had Syria (De Domo, c. 26).

falalem,] Markland has a note 011
‘fatalis' and the verb ‘malle' ⁶ Fatalis’
being that which is determined by Fatum,
that which must happen (In Cat. iii. 43 iv.
l), it would be an inconsistency for Cicero
to say that he preferred this year being
fatal, in the Roman sense, to himself rather
than to his country. But ‘fatalis’ has also
the sense of ‘ perniciosus‚’ as it has here,
but, adds Markland, with the addition of
the signification of a certain Fatum which is
the cause of the evil. But the word could not
be used here in either sense. The conclusion
is that Cicero did not write this passage.

Gesner gave an answer to this criticism
of Markland, and a pretty good answer.
But Wolf still maintained that Cicero could
not write thus.

octo] ‘hoc,' P.; ‘hos,’ G. Eight tri-
bunes were ready ‘pi-omulgarc,’ and two
refused.

consules modesti] He is sneering at the
consuls of B.c. 58, L. Calpurnius Piso and
A. Gabinius, who affected to be unable to

do any thing because Clodius had carried a
Lex which forbade any one from proposing
Cicero's recall (Pro Sestio, c. 32; De Domo,
c. 26). A passage 111 3 letter to Atticus
makes this plain (iii. 15) ε “ Ast tute scrip-
sisti ad me quoddam caput legis Clodium
in curiae poste fixisse, Ne referri neve dici
liceret.’'

quam meus] ‘quam’ is Lambinus' emen-
dation. The MSS. have ‘cum,⁷ as Halm
sayS. If some of them have ‘ quum,’ which
may he the case, it is easier to understand
how the mistake arose. The common read-
ing is ‘ quum . . . promulgavit ς’ for which
Ernesti would write ¹ quum . . . promulga-
visset.’

si quum hostes . . . revertis-cem] The
reading of E. F. P„ which Wolf had con-
jectured to be the true reading. But P.
has ‘ sicut ostes’ and F. has ‘si eum hostes.'
The reading of the other MSS. and the
common reading of the editions is ‘si aut
hostes . . . aut ego non revertissem! There
is now no occasion to recur to Manutius'
explanation of the common reading, which
explanation Klotz considers to be quite
right. The play on the words ⁴ si revixis-
sent ii‚’ διο, 15 mere trifling. Clodius of
course meant to say that Cicero should not
return till the men came to life again who
had been punished for their share in Cati-
lina's conspiracy; which was the same
thing as saying that he should never re-
turn. The writer gives the words another
meaning.

Τ116 ‘interfectores rei publicae' is a
strange expression. I do not know that it
is Ciceronian. Markland thinks that itis
