534 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO
terreri et latere. Perfecit ut, quoniam sibi in illum legibus uti
non liceret, illius vim neque in suo neque in rei publicae periculo
pertimesceret.

XLII. Quomodo igitur hocin genere praesidii comparati accusas
Sestium, quum idem laudes Milonem? An qui sua tecta defendit,
qui ab aris, focis ferrum flammamque depellit, qui sibi licere vult
tuto esse in foro, in templo, in curia, jure praesidium comparat3
qui vulneribus, quae cernit quotidie toto corpore, monetur, ut
aliquo praesidio caput et cervices et jugulum ac latera tutetur,
hunc de vi accusandum putas? Quis enim nostrum, judices, ignorat
ita naturam rerum tulisse, ut quodam tempore homines nondum
neque naturali neque civili jure descripto fusi per agros ac dispersi

el latere. meecit τιὴ] This is Mad-
vig's emendation, and it is ingenious, but
the corrupted readings may mean something
else. The Mss. readings are ‘ctiam eripi
rejecit,’ says Manutius; all that he had
seen. Halm also cites ⁴ etiam eripere elegit
ut‚’ G. Manutius says, “video sane ter-
tium quiddam desiderari, quod referatur ad
illud an caussam susceptam qffliyeret .'7 nam
cum dixit et vinci, spectavit illud cervices
daret: cum autem deterreri respondit ad
illud se domi contineret.- verum etsi for-
tasse licet sententiam divinare, quibus ta-
men verbis explicetur, apertum non est.”

42. Quis enim . . . iquoral] This may
be answered by another question, who does
know it ? Horace (Sat. i. 3. v. 99) has drawn
the same picture of the condition of man in
what some writers pleasantly call a state of
nature, from which state of nature man
emerges by civilization, as it is termed, and so
attains to an unnatural state. This conclu-
sion derived from the abuse of the words
‘natural' and ‘unnatural' is not entirely
false, for modern society is living partly in
an unnatural and partly in a natural (κατὰ
φύσιν) state, the unnatural being the result
of false civilization, the natural of true. The
state of existence which is most conformable
to man's nature cannot be called the Unna-
tural, and it may be called the Natural state.
There is indeed no absolute natural state,
no absolute civilization. Each race, each
age, each country has its own. Cicero is
describing what we call the savage state,
which under given circumstances is natural,
is conformable to man's nature; but it is
a state which does not allow man to attain
the highest excellence of which he is capa-
ble. The state of society which shall give
the greatest number an opportunity of being
every thing of which they are capable, is the

state most conformable to man’s nature,
because conformable not to a part, but to
the whole of his naturc; and this state may
properly be calledthe Natural. No nation has
yet attained to this Natural state, which is
the dream of enthusiasts, the hope of the
benevolent, and the despair of the wisc.
neque naturali neque civili jure de-
scripto] I suppose that it ought to be ⁴ dis-
cript0‚' but I find no notice of this reading.
The Roman definition of Jus Civile is given
in another place (De Harusp. c. 14). ‘Na-
turalis ratio ’ according to the Romans was
the foundation of what they called Jus
Gentium. The Romans had accordingly two
divisions of Law with reference to its origin z
Jus Civile, or the Roman Law; and Jus
Gentium or ι1115 Naturale, that which is
Law among all people, for Jus Gentium and
Jus Naturale mean the 531110 thing. The
origin of the Jus Gentium is Naturalis ratio.
Ulpian has a threefold division of Law
(De Justitia et Jure, Dig. i. l, l; 4, 6),
which rests on the following view. There
was a time in which men recognized only
those relations to one another which they
have in common with beasts3 that of the
sexes and that of the continuance of the
race, and nurture. Upon this followed a
second period, which established States,
Slavery‚ Private property, Obligationes, and
among all mankind in the same way. At
last Law fashioned itself in every separate
State in a peculiar way, partly through de-
viations from those general rules, partly by
the addition of new rules (savigny, System,
&c. vol. i. Beylage l, where something
more is said of this matter). But the really
practical division of Law into two parts was
that which prevailed among the Romans.
The following passage contains the Roman
notion as to the origin of the Jus Naturale
