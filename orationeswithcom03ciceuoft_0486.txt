472 INTRODUCTION TO THE

day. The acts for which he was tried took place after. ‚On his coming
into the temple of Castor, trusting to the sanctity of his office and there
making an Obnuntiatio to the consul, Clodius’ men fell on him and he
barely escaped with his life. Thongh Sestius alone had cause to com-
plain of this violent attack, it was made one of the charges against him ;
and the other charge was that from this time he had gladiators about
him, and carried measures by threats and force.

Sestius was defended by Q. Hortensius and M. Crassus. The γ -

Scholiast adds C. Licinius Calvus as one of the defenders of Sestius3
but Macer Licinius, as Cicero calls him in a letter to his brother (Ad
Q. Fr. ii 4), is merely mentioned as being on Sestius’ side (a Sestii sub-
selliis surrexit) 3 as a witness, as some suppose. The orators distributed
the parts of the defence among them, and Cicero spoke last (c. 2).
“Accordingly Tullius managed the part which was assigned to him3
nor did he, as most people have supposed, digress from the matter3 for
though we know that Cicero when under the influence of anger or of
vexation about his sufferings‚ was accustomed to exaggerate even beyond
what circumstances required, yet his filling a large part of this speech
with a long description of a very turbulent time seems in 110 small
degree to be connected with the present business. For it was necessary
to show the riotous and turbulent proceedings' and illegal acts of Clodius
fron] which Cicero had suffered, and the advantage which his country had
got by his restoration ; and that if it be allowed that Sestius got armed
men together for a proper purpose and of necessity, for that reason of
all others he ought to be acquitted of the present calumnious charge.”
The praetor who presided at this trial was M. Aemilius Scaurus, as
we are informed in one of Cicero’s letters (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 4) : “ Sestius
noster absolutus est a. d. 11 Id. Mart. (if that is the true reading,
‘pridie id. Mart.’) et quod vehementer interfuit rei publicae nullam

videri in ejusmodi caussa dissensionem esse, omnibus sententiis abso-
tus est.”

A large part of this oration is about Cicero himself. He begins with
a short sketch of Sestius’ early life (c. 1—5): but before speaking of
the tribuneship he considers it necessary to describe the turbulent
period of the previous year (13.6. 58). He begins with the story of
P. Clodius being adopted by a plebeian (13.6. 59) and so being qualified
to be elected a tribunus pl. (6. 6-15). We have then all the story of
Cicero being driven from Rome (c. 16—24)‚ and of the condition of
the commonwealth (13.c.58) in the consulship of Piso and Gabinius
(c. 25—31).

He then comes to the case of Sestius, and describes the measures
taken for his recall by his friends and the tribune Sestius among them ;
