maximas alter quum res gestas, tum etiam studium atque aures

Archias esset, eum „domum suam receperunt.

sima senectuti.

praetextatus] Halm considers this to be
a cunning misrepresentation, for ‘ praetex-
tatus’ was only said of a Roman youth.
It was a misrepresentation that would de-
ceive nobody. The chief part of the mis-
representation was probably in the man’s
age, for a ‘puer praetextatus’ under four-
teen, or sixteen at most, could hardly have
made such a sensation all over Asia, Greece,
and Magna Graecia as Cicero describes.
Manutius remarks Cicero’s inconsistency in
speaking of Archias as a ‘praetextatus'
when he arrived at Rome, and also speak-
ing of him as passing from boy's estate at
Antioch, and doing a great many things
before he got to Rome. He must have
been a wonderful youth, such as we have
sometimes heard and read of, and yet he
was only an ordinary man.

Manutius supposes the Luculli to be Lu-
cius and Marcus, who were afterwards the
patroni of Archias. They were boys (see
Introduction) when Archias came to R01ne;
but they were now men of mature age, and
the orator may purposely have neglected
the proprieties of time.

Sed jam hoe] Halm. The MSS. have
‘ Sed etiam hoc,' which Baiter retains and
marks thus (Τ). There is no difficulty
about the omission of ‘est' A difficulty
has been made about ‘ fuerit,’ and it has
been proposed to alter it into ‘patuerit.'
Halm explains ‘prima fuerit, scil. familiaris,’
which is to be got out of ‘familiarissimas
He refers to a like passage in Livy (37. c.
41): “ quae nihil adm‹)dum,'' &c.; and to
a passage in Cicero’s Laelius, e. ll: “ et
minime tunc quidem Caius frater, idem
nunc acerrimus,” where his explanation
is perhaps right; but Ι am not sure.
‘ Fuerit ' is the reading of G. E. A. Nine
Lagomarsini MSS. have ‘fuitss which Baiter
accepts. Madvig proposes ⁴ patuit.’

Metellus] Numidicus was consul 1³.c.
100. in which year and in 13.c. 108 he con-
ducted the campaign against ,Iugurtha and
had a triumph. He was banished by Ma-

rius' intrigues (Plutarch, Marius, c. 28, &c.).
His son gained the name of Pius for his ex-
ertions in restoring his father from exile
B.c. 99 (Plutarch, Marius, c. 31 ; Velleius,
ii. 15). Pius conducted the war against
Sertorius in Spain 13.c. 76. The position
of the words ‘ ejus Pio filio ' is common in
Cicero, as Halm shows by examples. Com-
pare Pro Cluentio, c. 8 : “Aurium et ejus
L. filium.''

audiebatur] Hence the Roman expres-
sion to be an ‘auditor‚’ to attend a man’s
instruction, as young men often attended a
jurist. Aemilius is M. Aemilius Scaurus,
consul B.c. 115, and 108; and an orator.

L. Crasso] This is the great orator
Crassus, the contemporary of the orator
M. Antonius (Vol. I. Divin. c. 8). Crassus
died in 13.c. 91.

Lucullos] It is supposed by some critics
that Cicero means the father L. Lucullus,
the propraetor of Sicily in B.C. 102. But
see the Introduction.

His son Lucius, who conducted the war
against Mithridates, was born before B.c.
105, but the year of his birth is not cer-
tain. He served in the Marsic war B.c. 90,
but that fact only shows that he must have
been then at least sixteen or seventeen.
He was consul in 13.c. 74, at which time he
ought to have been forty-two (Vol, ΙΙ. 1)6
Leg. Agr. ii. c. 2). Accordingly he may have
been born in B c. 116 or 117. The date of
the birth of Marcus Lucullus is not known.
He was Curule Aedile in uc. 79 with his elder
brother Lucius, when he ought to have been
thirty-seven years old. Cicero does not
speak on this occasion with much accuracy.
He says ‘Lucullos,’ meaning all the Luculli.
The Luculli, who were men of note when
this speech was delivered, were Lucius and
Marcus, the sons of the praetor (13.c. 102)
L. Lucullus, and he may mean them only,
as they were the only Luculli whom the
mention of the name would suggest to the
hearers at the time when this speech was
delivered.
