quo exire possimus quam curare, ut etiam illi qui absunt habeant

quo victores revertantur.

Quamquam est uno loco conditio melior

externae victoriae quam domesticae, quod hostes alienigenae aut
oppressi serviunt aut recepti beneficio se obligatos putant: qui
autem ex numero civium dementia aliqua depravati hostes patriae
semel esse coeperunt, eos, quum a pernicie rei publicae reppuleris,

nec vi coercere nec beneficio placare possis.

Quare mihi cum per-

ditis civibus aeternmn bellum susceptum esse video: id ego vestro
bonorumque omnium auxilio, memoriaque tantorum periculorum,
quae non modo in hoc populo qui servatus est, sedetiam in omnium
gentium sermonibus ac mentibus semper haerebit, a me atque a
meis facile propulsari posse confido: neque ulla profecto tanta vis
reperietur quae conjunctionem vestram equitumque Romanorum et

quo victores revertantur] “Mihi qui-
dem certe vir abundans bellicis laudibus
Cn. Pompeius multis audientibus hoc tri-
buit, ut diceret frustra se triumphum ter-
tium deportaturum fuisse, nisi meo in rem
publicam beneficio ubi triumpharet esset
habiturus'’ (Cic. De Off. i. 23). Cicero
said this which he says in the text at the
time of the conspirators being punished.
Pompeius must have said it afterwards, for
he was in the east at this time. The com-
pliment came from Cicero himself, and
Pompeius adopted his words; or what is
more likely, Cicero in his old age put them
in the mouth of Pompeius. He speaks of
this again (Phil. ii. 5): “Maxime vero
consulatum meum Cn. Pompeius, qui ut
me primum decedens ex Syria vidit com-
plexus et gratulans meo beneficio patriam
se visurum esse dixit.” Pompeius might
say this; and we easily see how Cicero
would turn what he said into 1115 own
rhetorical phrase when writing to his son
Marcus, to whom the treatise De Officiis is
addressed.

recepti] ‘recepti in amicitium,' Halm.—
‘reppuleris2’ Halm cites only two MSS.
which have this form. There is a reading
‘repuleris,’ and some other 1111181185.-
‘ aeternum bellumz' 118 says the same thing
again (Pro Sulla, c. 9). He knew that hc
could never make friends of the men whose
evil designs he had frustrated3 that neither
pardon nor any favour could conquer their
malignity. There are tempers which one
can never subdue by morey, by kindncss‚
or by forgiveness. To be defeated in their
designs is a thing which they never forget.
A prudent man therefore rcckons on the
eternal cnmity of those whose wicked dc-
signs he has thwartcd, and 118 thinks not of

peace with them, but war to the end of his
da s.

{d eqo vestro] There is a reading ‘ quod
ego vestro.y

conjunctionem] Two years later this
union of the two orders was 111 danger of
being destroyed, as Cicero says in two let-
ters to Atticus (i. 17 and 18): “Credo
enim te audisse nostros equites paene a
senatu esse disjunctos.’' One cause of the
danger was the promulgation of a Senatus
consultum about trying those who had re-
ceived bribes as ‘judices’ The other cause
that Cicero mentions was the greediness of
the Equites who farmed the revenues of
Asia. They had given too much for the
farm, and they asked the Senate to cancel
the lease. Cicero helped them and the
Equites got what they asked for: “sum-
mum erat periculum ne si nihil impetrassent
plane alienarentur a senatu.'¹ In the next
letter (18) he says: “Facto S. C. de am-
bitu, de judiciis, nulla lex perlata, exagitatus
senatus, alienati equites Romani. Sic ille
annus duo firmamenta rei publicae per me
unum constituta evertit, nam et senatus
auctoritatem abjecit et ordinum concordiam
disjunxit.” In his long letter to his brother
Quintus (Ad Q. Fr. i. l. c. 11), Cicero
shows what importance he attached to keep-
ing on good terms with the money interest
in the state, the ‘ ordo’ of the Publicani, as
he calls them. He knew that they were 1111
unprincipled greedy set of 111811, but 118
could not afford to quarrcl with 1118111. 118
says-2 “Atque huic tuac voluntati ac dili-
gentiac difficultatem magnam atl'crnnt pub-
licani, quibus si adversamur, ordinem (18
