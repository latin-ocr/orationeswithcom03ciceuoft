vagarentur tantumque haberent, quantum manu ac viribus per
caedem ac vulnera aut eripere aut retinere potuissent ἓ Qui igitur
primi virtute et consilio praestanti exstiterunt, ii perspecto genere
humanae docilitatis atque ingenii dissipatos unum in locum congre-
garunt eosque ex feritate illa ad justitiam atque ad mansuetudinem
transduxerunt. Tum res ad communem utilitatem, quas publicas
appellamus, tum conventicula hominum, quae postea civitates
nominatae sunt, tum domicilia conjuncta, quas urbes dicimus, in-

vento et divino jure et humano moenibus saepserunt.

Atque inter

hanc vitam perpolitam humanitate et illam immanem nihil tam

interest quam jus atque vis.

and the Jus Civile (Instit. ii. l. ξ ll): ‘⁶ Pa-
lam est autem vetustius esse naturale jus
quod cum ipso genere humano rerum natura
prodidit: civilia enim jura tunc coeperunt
esse quum et civitates condi et magistratus
creari et leges scribi coeperunt.⁷'

res acl communem utilitatem] P. G.
Halm (l)has ‘res communem utilitatem con-
tinentes.' After ‘ nominatae suntss Garatoni
and Madvig would add ‘instituerunt,’ be-
cause they took ‘ moenibus saepserunt’ in
the literal sense. Bake maintains that
these words are not to be taken in the lite-
ral sense3 and he compares In Pison. c. 2:
“ut a quo legibus uon poteramus, moe-
nibus tuti esse possemus ;” and Pro Caecina,
c. 26: “hacc jure civili saepta sunt.⁷’ He
proposes to read ‘ tamquam moenibus.' Halm
(2) has ‘ut moenibus ' and compares Cicero,
Paradox. iv. ξ 27 : “ sapientis animus virtu-
tibus omnibus ut moenibus saeptus.’' “ Ut
moenibus Ravius (praeeunte Bakio, qui tam-
quam moen. conjecerat): ut om. codd. et
Orelli ” (Halm).

Ι think that all the critics are wrong,
but in different ways. ¹ Moenibus saepse-
runt,’ which refers to ¹ domicilia conjuncta
quas urbes dicimus‚’ must be taken lite-
rally. The form of the sentence admits
only one verb: ‘Tum res . . . publicas,
tum conventicula . . . tum domicilia . . .
moenibus saepserunt3' and this one verb
must apply to all. He is speaking of every
thing that the city wall contained. The
Res Publicae are the things which are com-
mon to all, as temples, fora, and the like.
Cod. Par. has ‘res ad communem utilita-
tem continentes,’ which Klotz has in his
edition ot' Cicero. He first translated it:

Halm has

¹ the relations which hang together for com-
mon use, which we call State-unions ;’ and

Horum utro uti nolumus, altero est

in a note to his edition of Cicero he trans-
lates it: ‘the unions which hold together
for the purpose of the common interest,
which we call States3’ and he adds this
remark: “the participle continens stands
here in its proper signification. The word
in this sense is sufficiently protected by the
following expressions conventicula hominum
and domicilia conjuncta.’' There is some-
thing comical in this editor's sels-satisfac-
tion. Halm says, ‘⁴ Non miratus sum
Klotzium talia pro Tullianis venditasse, sed
illud miratus sum, quod, qui verba Latina
convertere vellet, ne quaesivit quidem quae
h. l. respublicae appellarentur. Non enim
intelliguntur ‘ Staaten ’ (states) sive ‘ Staats-
verbande' (state-unions), de his enim in
proximis agitur: tum conventicula homi-
num, quae postea civilates nominatae sunt,
sed res usibus populi perpetuo expositae,
quales sunt res sacrae, fora, basilicae, por-
ticus aliaque id genus. V. Cic. de Off. i. 173
Dig. 45. l. 137. ξ 6.’'

The passage has been obscured by a false
reading; and Halm has not quite seized the
full meaning, or he would not have inserted
⁴ ut ' before ‘ moenibus! The walls include
the whole, the houses, public places, and
the men who compose the state. Each
state had of course land outside the walls,
but it was the old Italian fashion to live in
the city, and to go out to cultivate the laud.
The city wall contained the state, for when
the wall was broken down, the political com-
munity was at the mercy of the conqueror,
and was dispersed or enslaved. Such was
one of the forms of social existence, in
which the notion of State was inseparable
from that of Urbs.
