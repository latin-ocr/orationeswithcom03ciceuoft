290 INTRODUCTION.

Pompeius, who arrived at Rome in the autumn of B.0. 623 and Metellus
returned with him.

Cicero did not take his province of Gallia Cisalpina after his consul-
ship. He gave it up to Q. Metellus Celer, the brother of Nepos, and
one of the Praetors of the year 62 ; and he stayed at Rome to look after
his own interests.

About the close of Rc. 62, in which year C. Julius Caesar was
Praetor, Caesar's wife Pompeia and other women were celebrating in
Caesar’s house by night, according to custom, the mysteries of the Bona
Dea (Cic. Ad Att. i. 13 3 Plutarch, Cicero, c. 28). Ρ. Clodius Pulcher,
a dissolute young patrician, who was supposed to have an intrigue with
Caesar's wife, got into the house during the ceremony disguised as a
female lute-player, but he was detected by the women and escaped
through the assistance of a girl; or as Plutarch says, he was found in
the chamber of a girl through whose help he got into the house (Plu-
tarch, Cicero, c. 283 Caesar, c. 10). This scandalous affair was brought
to the cognizance of the Pontifices, who declared it to ‚be a violation of
religion, and they ordered the religious ceremonies to be performed
again. Caesar put away his wife. The Senate also took cognizance of
the matter, and determined that there should be a judicial inquiry. But
instead of the guilt of Clodius being the only thing to inquire about, it
was made a party affair. A court was formed for the trial of Clodius,
and fifty-six judices were named as the jury. Cicero says that the jury
were a set of rascals, and were bribed, at least many of them. Thirty-
one judices voted for Clodius, who was consequently acquitted (13.0.
61). Cicero was one of the witnesses against Clodius, who attempted to
prove that he was not in Rome on the night of the mysteries. But
Cicero declared that Clodius was in Rome on that day, and had been
with him three hours before the time at which it was charged that he
had entered Caesar's house. Cicero was vexed that the judices paid so
little regard to his testimony, and after the acquittal he indulged in
jokes and sarcasms, which he never could restrain, both against Clodius
and the corrupted jury.

That party of the Senate to which Cicero had attached himself was
the Optimates, as he called them, the men who saw with fear and
jealousy the opportunity and the power which the long exercise of
military command gave to daring men. At the head of the party
opposed to Cicero was Caesar, who though too wdse to form such a
desperate attempt as Catilina, is suspected of having long had the
design of usurping the supreme power. Pompeius had now returned
from his eastern wars more powerful than ever, and Cicero, who had
always flattered the man, looked to him for protection. But Pompeius,
who had done many things in Asia which required the confirmation of
