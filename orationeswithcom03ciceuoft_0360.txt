346 INTRODUCTION TO THE

added to the value of Cicero’s house. The consuls immediately made a
contract for the restoration of the Porticus, and the undertakers, to the
great joy of the people, immediately set about demolishing what Clodius
had built.

These facts are told in a letter to Atticus (iv. 2), in the oration
against Piso, c. 223 and by Dion Cassius (39. c. 11), who says (c. 9)
that Cicero after his return thanked the Senate and the people, and
proposed the office of looking after the corn being intrusted to
Pompeius: he then continues (c. 11): Cicero accordingly again re-
covered his power, and not only the rest of his property, but the
ground on which his house had stood, though it had been dedicated to
Libertas and consecrated: for Cicero attacked the Lex Curiata by
which Clodius had been adopted into a plebeian family, on this ground,
that it had not been promulgated for a ‘trinundinum,' as custom re-
quired, and accordingly he invalidated all the tribunate of Clodius in
which he had acted with respect to Cicero⁷s house, for he argued that
nothing could be legally done by a tribune who had been illegally
adopted into a plebeian family; and so he induced the Pontifices to
decide that the site of his house should be restored to him free from all
religion. Thus Cicero got the site of his house and money for rebuild-
ing it, and for restoring the rest of his property to which damage had
been done.

Cicero says to Atticus (iv. 2) about the oration De Domo: “Diximus
apud pontifices pridie Kal. Octobres. Acta res est accurate a nobis: et
si umquam in dicendo fuimus aliquid, aut etiam si numquam alias fuimus,
tum profecto doloris magnitudo vim quandam nobis dicendi dedit.
Itaque oratio juventuti nostrae deberi non potest, quam tibi, etiam si
non desideras, tamen mittam cito.'’ Many learned men have thought,
and some editors of Cicero still think, that this long, rambling, feeble,
tasteless production which we now have under the name of Pro Domo
or De Domo, is that which Cicero describes as one of his highest orato-
rical efforts. Seb. Corradus, a scholar and a man of sense too, quoted
by Wolf, declares it to be ‘ prope omnium pulcherrimam? But a better
judge says that one cannot imagine any thing more barren, insipid, and
stale, unless it be the oration De Haruspicum Responsis (Markland) ;
which is a just judgment. The Declamator put all his strength in the
last, and there he has surpassed himself. .

It is difficult, says Wolf, to give a summary of this speech on account
of the wonderful variety of things in it and the want of order. blanu-
tius distributes the matter thus. In the first part the orator replies to
Clodius, who had found fault before the Pontifices with what Cicero
had said in the Senate about setting Pompeius over the Res Frumen-
taria. In the second part, he shows that according to the Law of
