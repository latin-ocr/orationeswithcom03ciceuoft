496 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

mutabit? ne isti quidem, quos legatos non modo nullo senatus con-
sultO, sed etiam repugnante senatu, tibi tute legasti ἓ Ergo hominis
desperati et proditoris rei publicae casum lugebunt fortasse qui
volent; civis florentissimi benevolentia bonorum et optime de salute
patriae meriti periculum conjunctum cum periculo civitatis lugere
senatui non licebit? Iidemque consules,—si appellandi sunt consules,
quos nemo est quin non modo ex memoria, sed etiam ex fastis evel-
lendos putet,—pacto jam foedere provinciarum, producti in circo
Flaminio in contionem ab illa furia ac peste patriae, maximo cum
gemitu vestro illa omnia, quae tum contra me contraque rem pub-
licam ..... , voce ac sententia sua comprobaverunt.

cente,' ‘tacente,' and perhaps, says Halm,

quos leyatos] We might infer from these
that is the right meaning of ‘sedente’

words that the Senate properly named the

legati3 aud this may have been the rule,
but it was now a time when the generals
at the head of their armies were beginning
to assume powers which belonged to the
Senate. Manutius refers to In Vatin. c.
l5. Madvig agrees with J. F. Gronovius,
who would strike out ‘ legatos ' in this pas-
sage, for no reason at all, as I think. Halm
judiciously defends it.

quin non modo] Garatoni corrected the
MSS. reading ‘ qui non modo.’ The omis-
sion of an η in such a case is easily ex-
plained; but it is singular that every MS.
should omit it, if every MS. does.

producti] This is the usual form. Clo-
dius brought the consuls forward in the
Circus Flaminius, and asked them what
they thought of Cicero’s consulship. Piso
answered: “crudelitatem tibi non placere,”
as Cicero says, repeating his words (In
Pison. c. 6). The Circus Flaminius was
out of the Pomoerium, and the ‘contio'
was held there that Caesar might be pre-
sent, for Caesar could not enter the city, as
he was ‘ cum imperio! See Quum Senatui,
c. 13, and the note on Dion Cassius, 38.
c. 17; and Quum Senatui, c. 6, and the
note.

15. sedentibus] There is no reason why
this should not mean ‘in their curule
chair,' as Ernesti says. In the In Vatin.
c. 7, which Garatoni cites “sedentibus in
templo duobus non consulibus,'' it can
mean nothing else. In the Quum Senatui,
c. 5, there is ‘inspectante et sedente,' where
Wolf explains ‘sedente' to mean ¹ quies-

there, because ⁴ sedere' is the second verb.
Compare this passage with the Quum Sena-
tui, c. 5, as to the Lex of Clodius, and the
notes. “Quattuor leges rei publicae per-
niciosas tulit P. Clodius in tribunatu: de
annona, ut populo frumentum gratis dare-
tur : alteram, ut collegia restituerentur:
tertiam, ut infirma censorum potestas esset:
quartam hanc, de qua hic Cicero loquitur.
v. infra, c. ‘25; In Pison. c. 5 3 Dion Cass.
38. e. 13” (Manutius).

ne quis leqi intercederet :] Clodius’ Lex,
as we are told, declared that the ⁴ auspicia '
should have no effect, that no magistratus
should interrupt a popular assembly by his
⁴ obnuntiatio,’ and that no one should put a
veto on a Lex, should stop its enactment
by any objection, or, if we like, by an ‘ ob-
nuntiatio,’ for that has just been men-
tioned, and ‘ne quis legi intercederet ' may
mean no more. It certainly does not mean
that Clodius by a Lex put an end to the
tribunitiam ‘ intercessio.' Halm, after ex-
amining the question, concludes from all
the passages which he cites that the ⁴ inter-
cessio ’ is meant which was effected by the
‘ obnuntiati0,’ since when a magistratus was
holding comitia, magistrates of equal autho-
rity and tribuni pl. could use the ‘obnun-
tiati03’ for in this way the enactment of
Leges was prevented no less than by the
tribuni pl. using their peculiar power of
‘intercessio ⁷ (Halm). If this passage is
correct, we must assume that there was both
a Lex Aelia, and a Lex Fufia. See c. 26 3 aud
Quum Senatui, c. 5, note.
