ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 13

Senate. Sallust has preserved the substance of his speech (“ hujusce-
modi orationem habuit‚’' Cat. c. 52). He might have given us the very
words. “They say that this is the only speech of Cato which is pre-
served, and that it was owing to Cicero the Consul, who had previously
instructed those clerks, who surpassed the rest in quick writing, in the
use of certain signs which comprehended in their small and brief marks
the force of many characters, and had placed them in different parts of
the Senate-house. For the Romans at this time were not used to
employ, nor did they possess, what are called note-writers, but it was on
this occasion, as they say, that they were first established in a certain
form '’ (Plutarch, Cato, c. 23 ¹).

There was no confirmation of the sentence of the Senate by the
people. The Consul was too prudent to let the conspirators live
through the night. “ He first took Lentulus from the Palatine, and
led him through the Sacred Road and the middle of the Forum, with
the men of highest rank in a body around him as his guards, the people
the while shuddering at what was doing, and passing by in silence, and
chiefly the youth, who felt as if they were being initiated with sear and
trembling in certain national rites of a certain aristocratical power.
When Cicero had passed through the Forum and come to the prison, he
delivered Lentulus to the executioner, and told him to put him to
death ; he then took down Cethegus, and every one of the rest in order,

¹ and had them put to death '' (Plutarch, Cicero, e. 22). The conspirators

were pitched down into a hole in the Tullianum, about twelve feet deep,
and the executioners, who were waiting below, strangled them as they
fell; Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, Gabinius, and Caeparius (Sallust,
Cat. c. 55). Cicero saw that the work was done, as Appian says (B. C.
ii. 6). It is probable that he would not trust any body. When he
came out, he told the crowd who were standing about the prison that
the conspirators ⁴ had lived.’ He was accompanied to his house by the
shouts and applause of the citizens. There were lamps and torches at
the doors; and the women put lights on the house-tops. There were
all the signs of rejoicing at the escape from a great ealamity.

Early in the next year Catilina was attached near Pistoria (Pistoia)
in Etruria, to which place he had led his men with the intention of

¹ The Romans had short-hand writers They called them ‘ actuarii ’ and ‘notarii‚' of
which last word the σημειόγραφοι of Plutarch is a translation. Martial mentions short-
hand writers,—
“ Currant verba lieet, manus est velocior illis,
Nondum lingua suum, dextra peregit opus.'’
Martial, Epiy. xiv. 208.

It is not likely that short-hand writing was invented for the occasion, as Plutarch says.
It may have been used then for the first time in the Senate.
