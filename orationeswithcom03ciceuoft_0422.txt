408 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

meretrix fuisse dicitur. Ejus non longe a Tanagris simulacrum e'
marmore in sepulcro positum fuit. Hoc quidam homo nobilis, non
alienus ab hoc religioso Libertatis sacerdote, ad ornatum aedilitatis
suae deportavit ς etenim cogitarat omnes superiores muneris splen-
dore superare. Itaque omnia signa, tabulas, ornamentorum quod
superfuit in fanis et communibus locis tota Graecia atque insulis
omnibus, honoris populi Romani caussa, sane frugaliter domum
suam deportavit. Is posteaquam intellexit posse se interversa
aedilitate a L. Pisone consule praetorem renuntiari, si modo eadem
prima littera competitorem habuisset aliquem, aedilitatem duobus
in locis, partim in arca, partim in hortis suis, collocavit: signum
de busto meretricis ablatum isti dedit, quod esset signum magis
istorum quam publicae libertatis. Hanc dea-m quisquam violare
audeat, imaginem meretricis, ornamentum sepulcri, a fure sublatam,
a sacrilego collocatam? haec me domo mea pellet? haec ultrix

interversa aedilitate] We can guess what
is meant, but the exact, meaning of ‘ inter-
versa ’ in this passage is doubtful. In
Cicero (Phil. ii. e. 32) it means ‘to inter-
cept and misappropriate 3’ and also in
another place (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 4. c. 30):
“ qui si intellexerint, interverso hoc regali
dono, graviter vos tulisse, grata fore vobis
populoque Romano sua studia ac dona arbi-
trabuntur ;” and the two passages from the
Digest cited there. Appius saw that if he
gave up the chance of the aedileship, he
might get himself returned as praetor, ‘si
modo - . . aliquem :' ‘if he had only some
competitor with the same first letter to his
name! Ferrarius thinks that this is to he
explained by supposing that it refers to the
abbreviations of the names of the candidates
on the voting tablets, and their being frau-
dulently misread. But this is only a guess.

in arca,] Baiter has ‘in area‚' and he
mentions no readings. ‘Arca' and ‘area'
are easily confounded. I cannot conjecture
what sense Baiter gives to ‘area' Appius
gave up the aedileship and saved the eost:
he put the money in his chest, and the
statues in his gardens, except the woman’s
statue.

magis istorum] Markland says that the
man ought to have written ‘istorum licen-
tiae,’ as he opposes ‘libertas ’ and ‘licentia’
iu c. 51, where he thinks that ‘licentiae’
should perhaps be ‘licentiae tuae‚’ the
‘ tuae ' having been swallowed up by the end
of the ‘licentiae’ Markland shows that
Licentia and Libertas are often contrasted:
Livy, iii. 37 ; Cicero, De Legg. ii. 17.

α sure sublatam,] Appius Claudius a

thies, one of the praetors of the year (13.c.
57), who had not opposed Cicero's re-
turn, with whom Cicero was afterwards on
terms of intimacy and pretended friendship.
Markland cannot believe it possible that
Cicero would have said this3 nor is it pos-
sible if he had now been fully reconciled to
Appius, but that reconciliation was later
than 13.c. 57 (Ad Div.,i. 9). Gesner de-
fends the ‘thies’ well, by showing that it
was Cicero's fashion to abuse people 111 this
way and afterwards to be friendly with them.
He refers to what Cicero says in Toga
Candida against C. Antonius, who was
afterwards his colleague in the consulship.
But that is not much of an argument.
Cicero could not prevent Antonius being
his colleague, aud he kept a sharp eye on
him. Cicero's behaviour to Vatinius is more
to the purpose. He branded the man in
the extant oration (In Vatinium), and he
afterwards defended 111111 (Ad Fam. i. 9),
aud corresponded with him (Ad Fam. v.
9, &c.). Wolf says, ‘⁴ Nunc statuat quisque
pro suo de tota re judicio: per nos licebit.''
See what he says, c. 33 and the note. The
Declamator could have no hesitation about
calling Ap. Clodius a thief. It was a small
matter this of thieving : he had been charged
with thicving himself (c. 34).

ullria‘] Ernesti altered this to ‘vic-
trix,’ and Baiter shows his want of judg-
ment by putting it into his text. “Quasi
altura civitatem afflictam a Cicerone, vin-
dictam εωρρίὶίηνα tyrannicae injuriae ab
eo suis civibus illatae. Quippe huc refer
consilium Clodii in statua Libertatis consti-
tuenda: quale consilium et Graeci sequuti
