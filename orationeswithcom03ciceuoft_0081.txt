CAP. 9, 10. 67

fortes viros partim ejecit ex civitate, partim interemit. Cn. Octa-
vius consul armis ex urbe collegam suum expulit: omnis hic locus
acervis corporum et civium sanguine redundavit. Superavit postea
Cinna cum Mario. Tum vero clarissimis viris interfectis lumina
civitatis exstincta sunt. Ultus est hujus victoriae crudelitatem
postea Sulla; ne dici quidem opus est quanta diminutione civium
et quanta calamitate rei publicae. Dissensit M. Lepidus a claris-
simo et fortissimo viro Q. Catulo: attulit non tam ipsius interitus
rei publicae luctum quam ceterorum. Atque illae tamen omnes
dissensiones erant ejusmodi, [Quirites] quae non ad delendam sed
ad commutandam reni publicam pertinerent: non illi nullam esse
rem publicam, sed in ea quae esset se esse principes, neque hanc
urbem conflagrare. sed se in hac urbe florere voluerunt. [Atque
illae tamen omnes dissensiones, quarum nulla exitium rei publicae
quaesivit, ejusmodi fuerunt ut non reconciliatione concordiae sed
internicione civium dijudicatae sint.] In hoc autem uno post
hominum memoriam maximo crudelissimoque bello, quale bellum
nulla umquam barbaria cum sua gente gessit, quo in bello lex haec
fuit a Lentulo, Catilina, Cassio, Cethego constituta, ut omnes

[ejecit ex urbe] ; C. Marium,'' διο. ; and he
thinks that ‘ ejecit ex urbe ’ may be a gloss
of‘oppressit.' He also thinks that if we
keep the punctuation which is in the text,
it will be hard to convince ourselves of the
genuineness of the words. Ι find it very
difficult to suppose that Cicero would say
that Sulla ‘oppressit’ P. Sulpicius, and
then that he should add ‘ejecit urbe3’ for
though Sulpicius was driven from the city,
he was caught (oppressus) and killed, but
Marius was driven out and not caught.
‘Oppressit' applies properly to Sulpicius,
and ‘ejecit’ to Marius Lambinus says that
‘ejecit ex urbe’ is not in some old MSS.
Cu. Octavius] He expelled his colleague
Cinna, B.c. 87 (Plutarch, Marius, c. 41);
but C. Marius joined Cinna at the end of
the year, when they broke into Rome, and
were elected consuls for 13.c. 86. Marius
and Cinna put to death many illustrious
men, the consuls Cn. Octavius and Merula,
the orator M. Antonius, whose death is told
by Plutarch in a most touching way (Ma-
rius, c. 44). Q Catulus who had fought
against the Cimbri and others. This savage
butchery was surpassed by the cruelty of
L. Sulla, who returned from the east and
made himself master of Rome (13.C. 232).
Nothing yet recorded in history is so bad
as the ferociens vengeance of Sulla (Florus,

F

iii. 21 ; vell. Pat. ii. c. 20).

M. Lepidus] He was consul in 13.c. 78,
the year of Sulla's death, and immediately
after the funeral he began to attempt to
undo Sulla’s work. His colleague Q. Ca-
tulus, the son of him who had fought
against the Cimbri, opposed him, and Le-
pidus fled to Sardinia, where he died of vex-
ation. There was no reason to lament him 3
and Cicero means to say that.

Atque illae—sint] Ernesti and others
after him have found a difficulty in this
sentence. The first part of the sentence at
least, which is a repetition of the beginning
of the preceding sentence, can hardly be
the genuine text of Cicero.

barbaria] Compare Pro Sulla c. 27. The
word Barbaria is used by Horace, Ep. i. 2. 7:

‘⁶ Graecia Bai-bariae lento collisa duello.'’

ut omnes -dncerentur,] ⁸⁴ That all should
be treated as cnemies whose lives would be
safe if the city were saved.'' This is said
too rhetorically; it is bad tas—te to aim at
an antithesis when the thought is obscur-ed
hy it. He means to say that every man
whose safety ‹lepended on the sat'ety os the
city would have been massacred by Lentu-
lus and the conspirators, who would con-
sider thern as euemies. The context shows
that ‘hostium numero ducere’ means to
