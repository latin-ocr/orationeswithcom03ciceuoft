266 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

crudelitate. Auctoritatem isti habeant apud eos quos esse omnino
noluerunt? Nam quoscumque potuerunt togatos interemerunt:
nomen civium Romanorum quantum in ipsis fuit sustulerunt.
XXVI. In hac igitur urbe se jactant quam oderunt? apud eos
quos inviti vident? in ea re publica, ad quam opprimendam non
animus eis, sed vires defuerunt? Aspiciant hunc florem legatorum
laudatorumque Flacci ex vera atque integra Graecia. Tum se ipsi
expendant, tum cum his se comparent, tum, si audebunt, dignitati

horum anteponant suam.

Adsunt Athenienses, unde humanitas, doctrina, religio, fruges,
jura, leges ortae atque in omnes terras distributae putantur: de
quorum urbis possessione propter pulchritudinem etiam inter deos
certamen fuisse proditum est: quae vetustate ea est ut ipsa ex sese
suos cives genuisse dicatur et eorum eadem terra parens, altrix,
patria dicatur: auctoritate autem tanta est ut jam fractum prope
ac debilitatum Graeciae nomen hujus urbis laude nitatur. Adsunt
Lacedaemonii, cujus civitatis spectata ac nobilitata virtus, non

la Malle has some remarks on it in his
Eeonomie Politique des Romains (Pati-ie des
Cereales, vol. ii.).

To Athens are attributed those social in-
stitutions which consist in the establishment
of law or a fixed rule of life, which is en-
forced by the power of the state. The

apud eos quos] ‘⁶ Shall the evidence of
such peoplc as these have any weight with
those whom they would not even allow to
live ?” He alludes to the great massacre in
Asia in which so many Roman citizens
(togati) perished.

26. expendant,] ‘Weigh themselves.'

⁴‘ Expende Hannibalem. Quot libras in
duce summo

Invenies ?” (Juv. Sat. x. 147.)

vera . . . Graecia] Klotz quotes Pliny
(Ep. viii. 24), who says in a letter to Maxi-
mus who was sent out as governor of Achaia z
“Cogita te missum in provinciam Achaiam,
illam veram et meram Graeciam, in qua
primum humanitas, litterae, etiam fruges,
inventae esse c1·eduntur.'’

Atheniense-Q] Lucretius (vi. 1) z
‘¹ Primae frugiparos fetus mortalibus aegris

Dididerunt quondam praeclaro nomine

Athenae,

Et recreaverunt vitam legesque rogarunt.''
In another place Cicero says that ¹ fruges '
were first discovered in Sicily (Vol. I. Verr.
ii. 4. c. 48, and the note). Triptolemus
of Attica first turned the earth with a
plough and taught men to cultivate wheat.
The story is in ovid (Met. v. 1545) and else-
where. The origin ofthe Cerealia is a pro-
blem that has employed the diligenee of
modern writers as it furnishcd matter for
the imagination of the ancient. Dureau de

Romans however had the merit of giving
to law a more complete and practieal form.

The great chapter on the glories of Athens
is the Panegyricus of Isocrates (c. 4, δια),
where he has the old story of the Auctoch-
thonity of the Athenians (compare Thucy-
dides, i. 2).

possessione] ‘ Positione‚' A. F. But
‘ possessione ' is the right reading. Posei-
don and Athena disputed for the possession
of Athens, and Athena gave to it her
name.

Lacedaemonii‚] This is a ‘ locus commu-
nis.' The eritics observe that Cicero passes
over the changes made by Philopoemen,
the commander of the Achaean league.
However, as usual, he is speaking ⁴ oratorie '
and in general terms. He seldom troubles
himself about historieal aecuraey. Plutarch
(Philopoemen, e. 16) says that Philopoemen
destroyed the institutions of Lycurgus, but
the Lacedaemonians afterwards obtained
permission from the Romans to restore
things to their former state, as far as it was
possible after the ill treatment they had
received.
