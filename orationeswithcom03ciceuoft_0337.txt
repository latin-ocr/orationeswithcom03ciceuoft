GAP. 13, 14. 323

interfectus, mihi turpe, si cum multis, rei publicae funestum fore
videbatur. Quod si mihi aeternam esse aerumnam propositam
arbitrarer, morte me ipse potius quam sempiterno dolore mulctas-
sem. Sed quum viderem me non diutius quam ipsam rem publicam
ex hac urbe afuturum, neque ego illa exterminata mihi remanen-
dum putavi, et illa simul atque revocata est me secum pariter
reportavit. Mecum leges, mecum quaestiones, mecum jura magis-
tratuum, mecum senatus auctoritas, mecum libertas, mecum
etiarn frugum ubertas, mecum deorum et hominum sanctitates
omnes et religiones afuerunt. Quae si semper abessent, magis
vestras fortunas lugerem quam desiderarem meas; sin aliquando
revocarentur, intelligebam mihi cum illis una esse redeundum.
Cujus mei sensus certissimus testis est hic idem, qui eustos capitis
fuit, Cn. Plancius, qui, omnibus provincialibus ornamentis com-

14. reportavit] Ε. F. have ‘revocavit.'
Wolf says, “ Nec sane displicet res publica
Ciceronem reportans, praesertim si currum
auratum recogites;” the ⁴ currus auratus'
in which he returns in c. ll. The ‘res
publica ’ was ‘ exterminata,' sent out of the
limits of the city, when Cicero was, or
rather it was sent out before he went, and
he would not stay after it was gone. This
is very complimentary to all the rest who
stayed. He does not say that he and the
⁶ res publica ' were together all the time that
both of them were away ς but the ‘ res pub-
lica' called for him and took him back.

But in the next sentence we learn that
every thing left Rome when he did, and
every thing returned with him (mecum, me-
cum). A more stale‚ flat piece of absurdity
than this cannot be found even in a writer
of the present day. But Markland has de-
tected a serious falsehood. ‘ Frugum uber-
tas ’ returned with him, as he says in the
next oration (c. 8). But Cicero tells us in
a letter to Atticus (iv. l) that on the nones
of September, the day on which he addressed
the Senate and the day before, provisions
were exceedingly dear. Accordingly the
fact is that scarcity came back with him;
nor did prices fall until Pompeius was ap-
pointed ‘ praefectus annonae ' by a Lex
passed on the proposal of Cicero. If, says
Markland, Cicero had spoken in this way
to the Quirites on the Nonae Septembres
or 3. d. 8 Id. Septembres, the latest date to
which we can assign the next speech, he
would have been pelted with stones, and he
would have deserved it for such an impu-
dent lie. He might say what is said in the
oration De Domo, 0. 7, because that was

delivered at the end of September.

Gesner answers Markland out of the ora-
tion De Domo, c. 6, where Cicero says
that prices fell as soon as the Senate had
passed a Decretum in favour of his return ;
but, as Wolf observes, the time he is there
speaking of is the fourth of August. Prices
fell a month before his return, if we accept
this passage as authority 3 but that will not
prove that the low prices continued a month
after and existed at the time of Cicero's re-
turn. We know that prices were high when
Cicero returned,and Clodius’ faction said that
Cicero's return was the cause of it. Klotz's
note on the ‘frugum ubertas ’ is this: ‘⁴ It
had been a year of scarcity. We find in
the following speeches still more on this
matter, because Cicero succeeded in getting
a commission to look after corn conferred
on Pompeius.'’ And this is all that a man
has to say on this passage who tells usin
his preface (p. 7) that “we think that for
those who corne to examine the question
free from prejudice‚ we have sufficiently
proved the genuineness of these speeches
in the notes which accompany this volume.”
One can understand well enough that prices
might fall in one month and rise again in
another, especially if the scarcity was not
real, but rather due to the dealers. And
we know that it was not altogether a real
scarcity, for prices fell as soon as Pompeius
was appointed to look after the supplies.

Cn. Plancius] Whom Cicero visited
during his exile, when Plancius was quaestor
in Macedonia. The words ‘ omnia provin-
cialia ornamenta et commoda ’ are ex-
plained by the oration Pro Plancio, c. 41:
‘⁴ Nam simulac me Dyrrachium adtigisse
