276 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

habeant jus civile? sint necne sint mancipi? subsignari apud
aerarium aut apud censorem possint? In qua tribu denique ista
praedia censuisti? Commisisti, si tempus aliquod& oravius accidisset,
ut ex iisdem praediis et Apollonide et Romae imperatum esset
tributum. Verum esto: gloriosus fuisti: voluisti magnum agri
modum censeri, et ejus agri qui dividi plebi Romanae non potest.
Census es praeterea numeratae pecuniae cxxx. Eam opinor tibi
numeratam non esse abste. Sed haec omitto. Census es mancipia
Amyntae. Neque huic ullam in eo fecisti injuriam. Possidet enim
ea mancipia Amyntas. Ac primo quidem pertimuit, quum te
audisset servos suos esse censum. Rettulit ad jurisconsultos.
Constabat inter omnes, si aliena censendo Decianus sua facere

 

posset, eum maxima habiturum esse *⁴ ἦε *2

it might be taxed also in Asia in respect of

the census of that province. For there was
a census in 1110 provinces also (Vol. Ι. Verr.
ii. 2. c. 53).

szcbsiqnari] “ Was it land that could be
undersigned at the ‘aerarium ’ or in the cen-
sors’ books '’ (tabulae). If we suppose that
each proprietor signed his return in the
‘ tabulae censoriae‚' we might give a mean-
ing to ⁴ apud censorem! But this is not
the meaning. Helias spoken of the census,
and he is now going to speak of another
thing that might be done, if the land was
really the same as Italian land The Scho-
liast has explained the passage: “Sulis sig-
nandi haec solebat ess e caus sa, ut aut qui
vectigalia redimeret aut qui pro mancipe
vectigalium fidem suam interponeret, loco
pigneris (sic) praedia 5113 rei p. obligarent,
quoad omnem pecuniam redemptores veeti-
galium repensarent.’' Those who farmed
the ‘ vectigalia‚' or those who became surety
for a farmergeneral, made an entry in the
treasury books or in the censors’ by which
their lands were bound as security to 1110
State. In England 1110 lands of treasurers,
receivers, and collectors sor the crown, cx-
cept when the yearly receipts are under a
certain sum, are bound without any for-
mality, and liablc 10 be taken and sold 10
make good any (1011010110)Υ 111 111011· accounts.

Geo. IV. 0. 121.)

ayri pindum] This is a common Roman
expres sion, The Lex of Licinius which
limited the Posses siones was 3 ‘Lex (10
modo agrorum ’(Livy vi. 155). So Horace

sayS, like a wisc man (Sat. ii. 6):

Nam ita questus est

‘⁴ Hoc erat in votis: modus agri non ita
magnus.'’

Provincia] land belonged to the Populus Ro-
manus according to Roman law. The Pro-
vincial had only the ⁴ usus.’ IfDecianus had
got the Quiritarian owner-ship of this land, it
could not be taken by the State and divided
among Romans as land in the provinces
sometimes was.—‘ non potestz’ ‘ non pos-
set,' Halm3 and perhaps right.

mamertium] This is money in coin (Vol.
I. Verr. ii. 5 c. 7). Cicero (De Leg. iii.
3): “Censores populi aevitates, soboles,
familias pecuniasque 00115 5.0111ο’ Cicero
means to say that Decianus never had so
much money: he nev·e1 counted so much.
Not counted to thee by thyself3 “ but ab
alieno; consequently the money was not
thine’⁷ (Klotz). I am not very curious to
know Cicero’s exact meaning in such pas-
sages as these. When he wishes to leave
some bad impression‚ he is content with the
few words that will do it.

aliem( censendo] There is a defect here3
but the sense is easily made out. If Decianus
could have made another man's property
his own by entering it in 1110 00115115, 110
would soon have grown rich. It is a plain
principle that 3 111311 could get no title to
another man’s property by registering it
in the censors' books as his own. It was
thought necessary however to state 11115
plain principle (Dig. 41. l. 64): “Quae
quisque aliena in censum deducit, nihilo
magis ojus fiunt'’ (from Q. Mucius seae-
vola).
