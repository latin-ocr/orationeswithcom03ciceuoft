the Senaie, was not yet ready to join any party. He wished for the
support of Cicero and the Senate ; and he wished for the favour of the
people too. The Senate did not confirm all that he had done in Asia3
and he failed also in an attempt to get his acts confirmed by the people.

Caesar had been governor of Hispania Ulterior during B.0. 61, and
he was now returned to Rome (B.c. 60). To further his own views, as
we may assume, he joined Pompeius, reconciled him with M. Crassus,
the richest man in Rome and formerly his enemy, and promised to give
Pompeius his assistance in procuring the confirmation of all that he had
(louein Asia. Among other things Pompeius had promised lands to
his old soldiers; and his future credit depended in some measure on
keeping this promise and on getting the Senate to confirm without
further inquiry all that he had done in Asia. This union of Caesar,
Pompeius, and Crassus (13.0. 60) (conspiratio, as the Romans sometimes
called it) is very improperly named by some modern writers the first
Triumvirate.

In Β.0. 59 C. Julius Caesar was consul with M. Calpurnius Bibulus.
Caesar wished to gain Cicero over, and he offered him the post of
Legatus when he should take a province after the expiration of his
consulship. Cicero refused an offer which might have saved him from
his enemies, but would have carried him away from Rome and all that
was most dear to him. When Caesar's Agraria Lex for the division of
the Campanian lands was carried, Caesar proposed to Cicero to be one
of the twenty commissioners for the division of the landS. Crassus and
Pompeius were of the number. But Cicero refused this offer too. His
conduct may have offended Caesar, who knew that such a man on his
side would be a valuable friend, and might be as useful in sounding his
praises when he should have gone to his Proconsular province, as he had
been to Pompeius. Caesar perhaps could have protected Cicero against
his enemies: it is certain that he did not. In this year Metellus Celer
died, and his death made a vacancy in the college of Augurs. Cicero
wished to have the place, and he says in a letter to Atticus (ii. 5) that
this was the only thing by which 116 could be gained over by Pompeius
and Crassus, and he means Caesar too. So it appears that· if these men
would have let him have the Auguratus, 116 was willing to join their
party. In the same letter he speaks of a mission to the king of Egypt,
which he might accept, if it were offered to him, though he fears what
the Optimates will say if he accepts such a commission from Caesar and
his friends. He might, however, he says, get some credit even by
refusing it. He adds, if Theophanes, the Greek, a favourite of
Pompeius, should say any thing on the matter, Atticus must not reject
the proposal at once.

Clodius still cherished his old grudge. In order to be qualified to be
