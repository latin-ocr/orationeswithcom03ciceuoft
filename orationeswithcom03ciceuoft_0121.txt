OAP. 9. 107

ipso propter periculum nostrum concessam videamur habere licen>-
tiam fingendi, publicis litteris testata sunt omnia, quibus L. Lucul-
lus tantum laudis impertit, quantum neque ambitiosus imperator
neque invidus tribuere alteri in communicanda gloria debuit.
Summa in utroque est honestas, summa dignitas3 quam ego, si
mihi per Servium liceat, pari atque eadem in laude ponam. Sed
non licet. Agitat rem militarem: insectatur totam hano legatio-
nem: assiduitatis et operarum harum quotidianarum putat esse
consulatum. Apud exercitum mihi fueris, inquit, tot annos? forum
non attigeris? abfueris tamdiu? et, quum longo intervallo veneris,
cum his qui in foro habitarunt de dignitate contendas? Primum
ista nostra assiduitas, Servi, nescis quantum interdum afferat
hominibus fastidii, quantum satietatis? Mihi quidem vehementer
expediit positam in oculis esse gratiam. Sed tamen ego mei satieta-
tem magno meo labore superavi, et tu idem fortasse: verumtamen
utrique nostrum desiderium nihil obfuisset. Sed ut 1100 01111550 ad
studiorum atque artium contentionem revertamur, qui potest dubi-
tari quin ad consulatum adipiscendum multo plus afferat dignitatis
rei militaris quam juris civilis gloria? Vigilas tu de nocte ut tuis

who were invited to help Murena. Lucullus
had tcstified his opinion of Murena by his
despatches sent to the senate (literae pub-
licae .

im)))erl2't‚] Halm writes ‘huic laudis im-
pertit‚’ with this remark: “ Huic quod
codd. omittunt, ex conj. addidi praeeunte
Lambin0‚ qui tantum Murenae laudis scrip-
serat: tantum ρι’ laudis Klotzius 2.’' Halm
writes ‘ impertit ;’ the reading of some Mss.
is ‘ impartit.y Ernesti proposed ‘imper-
tiit‚’ which Halm is inclined to. I prefer
the present. He indirectly praises Lucullus
for being neither a seeker after popularity
nor envious: he was willing to let another
share in his reputation. See the explana-
tion of ‘ communicare ’ (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3.
c. 203 Vol. II. Pro S. 11050. Am. c. 40).

in varoque] In Murena and Sulpicius.
——‘ agitat rem militarem :' if Servius would
allow it, Cicero would be content that he
and Murena should be considered equal.
But Servius will not allow it ι “ 110 does not
let the military art rest ;'' he assails it, he
ridicules it. “ He thinks the consulship is
the reward of diligence and of this daily
occupatiori.’' He speaks of the juriscon-
sult’s occupatiori 111 ‹licparaging terms.

Apud exercitum mihi] Compare In Cat.

mel satietatem] “ But still sor my part

by great exertion of my own Ι got the better
of people’s disgust.” This must be com-
pared with ‘quantum satietatis! The ora-
tor knew well that when a man is always
putting himself forward, showing himself
every where, people get tired of him. The
11131 may be useful. Cicero adds: ‘⁴ How-
ever it is quite true that it would have done
neither of us any harm, if we had been
missed for a time.''

de nocte] The critics do not seem to 110
quite agreed about the explanation of ⁴ de
nocte.' First, it means that it is night ; the
night is begun. A man who is awake any
part of the night, when people ought to be
sleeping, is said ⁴ vigilare de nocte.y Horace
has something of this kind (Ep. i. 2. v.
32) :

“Ut jugulent homines surgunt de nocte
latrones.''

They get up while it is still night to do
murder. Caesar and other Roman writers
often use 11115 expression (B. G. i. 12 ; ii. 7;
vii. 45, 88). It 15 accordingly said hy some
critics that ‘de nocte‚’ ⁴ (10 (110’ mean that
the night cr the day is not yet passed. This
is true3 hut it seems that ‘de dic' or ‘de
nocte ’ also means 11131 the event spoken of
takes place soon or immediately 31101· 1110
commencement of 1110 day or the night.
