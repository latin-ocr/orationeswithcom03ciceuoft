CAP. 13, 14. 371

adliibeat-ur3 ut haec simulata adoptio filii quam maximo veritatem
illam suscipiendorum liberorum imitata esse videatur. Quae
major calunmia est quam venire imberbem adolescentulum, bene
valentem ac maritum, dicere filium senatorem populi Romani sibi
velle adoptare; id autem scire et videre omnes, non ut ille filius
instituatur, sed ut e patriciis exeat, et tribunus plebis fieri possit,
idcirco'adoptari? neque id obscure: nam adoptatum emancipari
statim, ne sit ejus filius qui adoptarit. Cur ergo adoptabat?
Probate genus adoptionis: jam omnium sacra interierint, quorum
custodes vos esse debetis, jam patricius nemo relinquetur. Cur
enim quisquam vellet tribunum plebis se fieri non licere, angusti-
orem sibi esse petitionem consulatus, in sacerdotium quum possit
venire, quia patricio non sit is loeus, non venire? Ut cuique
aliquid acciderit quare commodius sit esse plebeium, simili ratione
adoptabitur. Ita populus Romanus brevi tempore neque regem
sacrorum, neque flamines, nec salios habebit, nec ex parte dimidia
reliquos sacerdotes, neque auctores centuriatorum et curiatorum
comitiorum3 auspiciaque populi Romani, si magistratus patricii

major calumnia] He has just used the
word with ‘fraus' and ‘dolusff Now he
says ⁴ Quae major calumnia quam.' There
was no ‘calumnia' in a beardless youth
coming and saying what he says here; the
‘ calumnia‚' if any, consisted in the purpose
of the adoption being fraudulent. See Vol.
II. Pro Habito, e. 31, note on ‘calumnia;’
and Vol. 1. Verr. ii. 1. c. 10. This adop-
tion might be a fraud; but hardly a ‘calum-
nia,’ for the object of ‘ calumnia ' is a defi-
nite person. However the word is some-
times used to express a fraud ulent purpose.
—¹ dicere filium:' ⁴ dicere se filium,’ Baiter,
for which he has some autliority.—-‘ sed ut
si . . . exeat, tribunus ε’ Halm, Baiter.—
‘ nam adoptatum emancipari ;’ the construc-
tion is not plain. Is the new father emanci—
pated Clodius, he would still be his son, but
not in his power.

anyustiorem] An allusion to the old
rule that only one patrician consul could be
elected each year, a rule which of course
limited the chance of election for thc patri-
cians. (Livy, 27. c. 343 and 39, c. 32):
“quia plus quam unum ex patriciis creari
non licebat, artior petitio c uatuor petentibus
erat.’' The writer of codrse is speaking of
the ‘ sacerdotia ' to which the ‘ plebes ’ only
were eligible. Ernesti changed ‘quisquam
vellet’ into ‘quisquam velit' in order to
make it Latin and consistent with what fol-
lows. It should be ⁴ velit,' and the author

may have written it SO.

reyem sacrorwm] The ‘rex sacrorum'
or ‘rex sacrificus' (Livy 40. c. 42) was a
priest who retained the name of ‘rexss as a
memorial of the time when the Roman
kings had the highest priestly office. But
he was subordinate to the Pontifex Maxi-
mus,

auctores . . . comitiorum ] He means
the Patricii, who were the ‘ auctores comi-
tiorum’ in the carly period; but not in
Cicero's time. Becker fflandbuch, i. 2. p.
320) thinks that the author of this speech
may have seen the passage in Livy (vi. 41)
in Claudius' speech : ‘⁴ non leges auspicato
ferantur, non magistratus creentur, nec cen-
turiatis nec curiatis comitiis patres auctores
fiant.'' The words ‘nec curiatis' are in
the passage as Becker cites it, but not in
all editions. They are probably not ge-
nume.

Klotz has a note on this passage: “ Here
as in many other passages Cicero’s words
have been taken by many persons too lite-
rally, when they maintain that these asser-
tions are at variance with Roman institu-
tions as they existed at that time. Nobody
knew that better than our orator. How-
ever, as a shadow of those ancient and at
this time unessential institutions still ex-
isted (compare the second speech in the
Lex Agraria, c. 12), accordingly he sought
to make use of this at least, in order to
