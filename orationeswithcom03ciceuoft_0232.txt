218 oIssAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

tiebant, Reginos credo aut Locrenses aut Neapolitanos aut Taren-
tinos, quod scenicis artificibus largiri solebant, id huic summa ingenii
praedito gloria noluisse. Quid, quum ceteri non modo post civita-
tem datam. sed etiam post legem Papiam, aliquo modo in eorum
municipiorum tabulas irrepserint, hic qui ne utitur quidem illis in
quibus est scriptus, quod semper se Heracleensem esse voluit, re-
jicietur? Census nostros requiris. Scilicet; est enim obscurum
proximis censoribus hunc cum clarissimo imperatore L. Lucullo
apud exercitum fuisse ς superioribus cum eodem quaestore fuisse in
Asia3 primis [Julio et Crasso] nullam populi partem esse censam.
Sed quoniam census non jus civitat-is confirmat, ac tantummodo in-

poribus, quae tu criminaris ne ipsius quidem judicio eum in civium

leyem Paphum] The object of this Lex civitas to those who were registered before
(B.c. 65) was to drive Peregrini from Rome, the Lex was passed. For want of exact
as Dion says (37. c. 9). It was proposed knowledge of facts, which Cicero very often

by a tr. pl. C. Papius. Cicero (De Off. iii. does not give us, we cannot tell what to

ll): “Male etiam qui peregrinos urbibus make of his argument. Archias did not

uti prohibent eosque exterminant, ut Pen-
nus apud patres nostros, Papius nuper.
Nam esse. pro cive qui civis non sit rectum
est non licere; quam tulerunt legem sapi-
entissimi consules Crassus et Scaevola: usu
vero urbis prohibere peregrinos sane inhu-
manum est.” This was the Lex under
which Archias was prosecuted, as it is stated
in the Schol. Bol). p. 354, Orelli.

ne ulitur quidem illis} Cicero never at-
tempts to show that Archias was registered
in any other state than Heraclea. He says
that he was, but he gives no proof of it.
He simply asks if it was probable that
Regium and other towns refused him that
which they were accustomed to give to
actm-s. Here he says that even after the
enactment of the Lex Papia, the rest, Ι (10
not know who they are, got their names
entered surreptitiously on the lists of those
munieipia; by which he means all those
places that he has mentioned, except He-
raclea. Archias, he says, did not make any
use of the evidence of these registem, be-
cause he always chose to consider himself
as belonging to Heraclea; and Halm finds
three good reasons for this. But as the
registers of Heraclea were burnt, and we
are not told that. the others were, we cannot
understand why Archias should not have
used their evidence. Indeed Cicero says it
was worth nothing, because their registers
were falsified3 aud they must have been
falsified iu dates as well as in names, sor
the Lex of Silvanus and Carbo only gave the

make use of these registers‚ on which his
name was entered, as Cicero says, and be-
cause he was resolved to pass for a citizen
of Heraclea. He may have given in his
name to Metellus as a citizen of Heraclea
only, and we must. conclude from all that
Cicero says that he had done so. Yet we

are not told that this prevented him from s

proving his title to the Roman civitas from
other registers. He simply did not choose
to refer to those registers, because he would
pass for a citizen of Heraclea: and in the
same sentence we are told that these regis-
ters were falsified. There is no sense in
this; and if the orator wrote it εο, he is
inexcusable.

Census nostros] See the Introduction.
The punctuation is not quite certain. Some
editions have ‘Census nostros requiris sci-
licet. Is enim.y Halm refers to Cicero Ad
Q. Fr. i. 3. l: “ Ego tibi irascerer? tibi
ego possem irasci? Scilicet3 tu enim ;⁷'
where ‘ Scilicet' cannot belong to ⁴ irasci.’
‘ Scilicet ' implies however a repetition of
the verb to which it refers.—‘ Julio et
Crasso? the names of the censors of B.c.
89. Manutius supposes them to be a gloss ;
and it is probable that they are.

quae tn . . . enm in civium] ⁴ Quem tu
. . . judicio in civiumss Halmfand Baiter ou
the authority of Cod. Oxoniensis C. G. Ε.
have the reading in the text. A. has ‘ quibus ’
for ¹ quae.’—-‘ne ipsius quidem judicio ε’ be-
cause he was not on the censors' lists.
