ORAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

et Drusum et Octavios et Catonem et totam Hortensiorum domum
Α devinctam consuetudine quum teneret, afficiebatur summo honore,
quod eum non solum colebant-‘qui aliquid percipere atque audire

studebant, verum etiam si qui forte sinnilahant.

IV. Interim satis

longo intervallo quum esset cumi-L. Lucullo in Siciliam profectus,

Drusum] M. Livius Drusus, tr. pl who
died in 13.c. 91. There vnere several Octavii
at the time of which Cicero is speaking.
Cn. Octavius was consul with Cinna 8-0
87. He had a son Lucius who was consul
13.c. 75.

Cato may be the father of Cato Uticensis.
Of the noble family of the Hortensii the
orator (consul B.c. 69) was the most dis-
tinguished.

4. salis lmzyo intervallo] Baiter and
Halm have ‘cum M. Lucullo,’ the correc-
tion of Schiitz. Stephanus altered ‘Sici-
liam' into ‘Ciliciam,’ and Weiske, Gara-
toni, and other critics have approved of the
alteration. Drumaun supposes L. Lucullus
to be the father.

It has been already said (Introduction)
that Archias came to Rome in Rc. 102,
but L. Lucullus the father went to Sicily in
that year, and Archias could not have ac-
companied him unless he was at Rome in
that year before Lucius left Rome. But it
is very unlikely that he went straightway to
Sicily with Lucullus. It was by living in
intimacy with the Luculli and others that
he gained general consideration (afficiebatur
summo honore). Again Cicero says ¹ satis
longo intervallo.' We do not know how
much this means, but it has no meaning at
all, if Archias went to Sicily in B.c. 102.
Drumann observes that Cicero speaks ob-
scurely in order to spare L. and M. Luculli,
who would not wish to have their father's
ill luck brought to mind in Rc. 62. Dru-
mann also argues that ‘decedere ex pro-
vincia’ is said of governors who leave a
province after the term of their government
has expired, and he adds that L. Lucullus,
the son, was never governor of Sicily, nor
his brother Marcus. The answer is that
‘ decedere ’ is not always so strictly used3
nor is it so used here, for Cicero says when
Archias ‘cum eodem Lucullo decederet.’
If he meant to say that Lucullus was leav-
ing the province, he would have said so.
Again, the plain meaning of the words is,
that Archias on leaving Sicily with Lucullus
went to Heraclea. Drumann, after a Ger-
man fashion of dealing with evidence, says :
“A tolerable long space of time did not
elapse between Archias' arrival in Rome

..f

and his entry on the roll of the citizens of
Heraclea, and people (man) did not. get
to Heraclea on the way back {rom Sicily.'’
This is childish trifling, and a pei-version of
the plain meaning. Drumann contradicts
Cicero, who may be lying sor what I know,
but Drumann cannot prove that Cicero is
lying. A man, or several men, if they
liked, might go to Heraclea, when they got
out ot Sicily. The narrative of Cicero means
that Archias spent some time in Rome, and
then ¹ a considerable time’ (satis longo in-
tervallo) after his arrival at Rome he went
to Sicily with L. Lucullus. If Lucullus
went to Sicily in some public employment,
Cicero would have said so, for that would
have raised the reputation of Archias. Halm
also says of the word ‘decederet,' “ which
form of expression was only applied to
magistrates or official personages,” that
“ Cicero, as Stiirenburg has well remarked,
has used the more important form of ex-
pression with rhetorical tact, in order to
set the journey of Lucullus in a brighter
light,⁷’ Lucullus being, as he supposes, the
son, M. Lucullus, for which we have only
Schiitz's authority, who knew no more of
the matter than we do. What rhetorical
tact, to use a word improperly in order to
make the Judices believe what they knew
not to be true! for Ι suppose, according to
this explanation, they were to believe that
M. Lucullus was governor of Sicily, though
he never had been ; or if this is not meant,
what is the meaning of setting the journey
in a brighter light? Halm (see Introd.)
says that it is probable that this journey of
M. Lucullus was connected with the pro-
secution which L. and M. Lucullus con-
ducted against the augur Servilius, by whom
their father Lucullus was prosecuted for
maladministration in Sicily= and being con-
victed went into exile. Plutarch (Lucullus,
c. l) mentions the prosecution of Servilius.
But why should M. Lucullus go to Sicily
on the occasion of the prosecution of Ser-
vilius? What was he to find there? If he
had gone to get evidence for his father
when he was prosecuted, there might be
some meaning in the journey. But this is
the way that men write history, as they
call it. They invent facts and indulge in
