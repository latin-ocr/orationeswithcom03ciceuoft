44 ORAT. ΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

mihi videntur vota facturi contra rem publicam quam arma laturi.
IX. Alterum genus est eorum, qui, quamquam premuntur aere
alieno, dominationem tamen exspectant, rerum potiri volunt, honores
quos quieta re publica desperant, perturbata se consequi posse
arbitrantur. Quibus hoc praecipiendum videtur, unum scilicet et
idem quod ceteris omnibus, ut desperent id quod conantur se
consequi posse: primum omnium me ipsum vigilare, adesse, pro-
videre rei publicae; deinde magnos animos esse in bonis viris,
magnam concordiam, maximam multitudinem, magnas praeterea
copias militum3 deos denique immortales huic invicto populo,
clarissimo imperio, pulcherrimae urbi contra tantam vim sceleris
praesentes auxilium esse laturos. Quod si jam sint id quod
cum summo furore cupiunt- adepti, num illi in cinere urbis
et sanguine civium, quae mente conscelerata ac nefaria con-
cupiverunt, consules se aut dictatores aut etiam reges sperant

9. quamquam premuntur] Ic is a useful
exercise to attempt to seize the idea which
is not expressed in direct terms, Cicero
says that there are men oppressed with
debt who wish to get political power, and
the high offices of the state, which they
despair of getting while things are tranquil.
But besides mentioning these two facts, he
attaches to them severally a ‘quamquam'
and a ‘tamen ς’ and both of these words
express some relation between the facts.
It is this, says Halm: “The thought ex-
pressed iu concessive form (it is his word)
depends on the political principle, that a
power which is not founded on property,
does not allow us to expect that it will have
strength to lastf’ This is certainly not
Cicero’s meaning. It is the eontrast be-
tween the condition of a man loaded with
debt, and his extravagant expectations which
Cicero places· in opposition ; with the addi-
tional remark that these expectations can
only be realized by a revolution.

‘ul desperem] Halm says that this does
not depend on ⁴praecipiendum‚' but on
‘unum s‹:ilic‹=t‚’ ἂψ, with which words it
forms an intcrmediate clause that we may
omit if we choose. This is so far true, that
‘hoc praecipiendum’ is explained by ‘pri-
mum omnium‚’ ‘dcimam' aud ‘denique;’
but how can Halm suppose that ⁴ ut despe-
rent ' does not dvpend on ‘ praecipiciuluui ?’
There is nothing else for it to depend ou.
The advice given, or to bc given, was ‘to
despair) Cicero says (Lai-lius, c. 115),
“Illud potius praecipiendum fuit ut cam
diligentiam adhibere1nus‚'' &c. The ‘ prae·

ceptum’ is further expounded by the forms
in the infinitive, ‘primum omnium—vigi-
lare,' διο. But this may scarcely seem to
explain why we have ⁴ praecipiendum ut,'
and then the following verbs in the infi-
nitive. The verbs ⁴ vigilare,' ‘ adesse‚’ and
the rest could not be in the subjunctive, for
they denote a fact that the revolutionists
ought to know. ‘ Praecipiendum ’ does not
seem to mean in this passage to ‘advise,’
but it means to ‘learn first‚' ‘to know be-
fore every thing else.' It may then be trans-
lated z ‘⁴ Ι think these men should learn one
thing, which indeed every body knows, to
despair of accomplishing their object while
I am consul; first of all, because Ι myself
am vigilant.’' The first thing of which he
says ‘praecipiendum ’ is a conclusion, and
this must be expressed by ‘ut' and the
subjunctive. The second thing of which he
says ‘praecipiendum' is a fact, and this
must be expressed as a fact, and either in
the indicative or the infinitive meod, accord-
ing to the structure of the sentence.

mavimam multitudinem] Halm writes
‘ in maxima multitudine) Two MSS. have
‘maxima in multitudine? I think the com-
mon reading is quite as good as his; and I
do not see the difficulty in “the defective
Annplmra ’¹ (whatever that may mean),
which consists in ‘maximus’ standing in
the middle of the three repeated ⁴ magnus,'
as he says. But this is easily answered. It
is not in the middle: it comes after a twice
repeated ‘ magnus ;’ and the third ‘ magnus ¹
is a ditl'crent, ⁴ niagmis‚’ introduced and pro-
tected by ⁴ praetcrea!
