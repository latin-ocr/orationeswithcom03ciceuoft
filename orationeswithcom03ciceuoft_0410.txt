396 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

amicorum testamentum discessu meo fecit, qui mihi non idem
tribuerit quod et si adessem? quis me non modo civis, sed socius
recipere contra tuam legem et juvare dubitavit? Denique univer-
sus senatus multo aute quam est lata lex de me, Gratias agendas
censuit civitatibus iis quae M. Tullium—tantumne? immo etiam,
Civem optime de re publica meritum recepissent. Et 111 1111115
pestifer civis 611111 restitutum negas esse civem, quem ejectum
universus senatus non modo civem, sed etiam egregium civem
semper putavit? At vero, ut annales populi Romani et monumenta
vetustatis loquuntur, Kaeso ille Quintius, et Μ. Furius Camillus, et
M. Servilius Ahala, quum essent optime de re publica meriti,
tamen populi incitati vim iracundiamque subierunt, damnatique
comitiis centuriatis quum in exsilium profugissent, rursus ab eodem

eorum sedibus exaedificatum templum Li-
centiae: pulsus a delubris is (1111 1113 561-
val-at.” But this passage does not seem to
me to prove that ⁸ discessu meo ’ is rightly
used hythe Declamator. Klotz adds that
Cicero would not admit that 116 was ⁸ in
exilio,' and that ‘discessu meo,' which he
says means ‘during the time of my going
away,’ 1101 ¹ at the time of my going away‚' 15
proper, and expresses his voluutary absence.
But there is a very simple way of expressing
that without using ⁶ discessu meo ' to signify
⁴ during the time of my going away.’

Klotz says that if Cicero had been legally
banished 116 would have been 011 1116 531116
footing as 0116 who was not 3 citizen, and
that no Roman could have made Cicero his
‘ heres.' This is said to explain the matter
about the will. He quotes as proof Cicero,
Pro Archia, c. 5. As usual his law is all
confusion.—-‘ quod 61 51 ε’ Baiter omits ό61.1

quis me . . . dubitavit ?] Cicero himself
will answer this. He says of C. Vergilius,
the praetor of Sicily: “Cum ipsa paene
insula mihi sese obviam ferre vellet, praetor
ille . . . me in Siciliam venire noluit ” (Pro
Plancio, 6. 4ος Plutarch, Cicero, c. 32).

lata lex de me,] He means the Lex about
his restoration; but he should have said
11.-ι Gratias agendas :¹ Markland says that
the man seems to have confounded two
different letters of the senate 3 one of which
recommended Cicero to the care of all whom
he came among, and another in which the
senate thanked them for doing what they
had been asked to do. The words of the
former letter are preserved in the oration
In Pisonem, c. 15, where he is entitled
‘civem conservatorem rei publicae.’ The
other letter is mentioned in the oration Pro
Sestio, c. 60 ς’ and by Plutarch (Cicero, 6.

33). Markland, who is very acute in seeing
many things, observes that here Cicero 15
merely called ‘civis optime de re publica
ineritus‚’ an expression which would be ap-
plied to many persons as a matter of course.
In the Pro Sestio he says ‘conservator rei
publicae.’

Kaeso . . . thinlizcs‚] The son of L.Quin-
tius Cincinnatus, who was driven away by
the popular clamour excited hythe tribunes
(Livy, iii. c. ll). The story of M. Furius
Camillus is in Livy (V. 6. 32).

Ahala's name was Caius, and so Baiter
writes it. (See In Cat. i. c. l, and the
note.)—⁴‘ De centuriatis comitiis mox cre-
dendum est rhetori.—Consuetudo haec erat,
ut, si quis ante comitia centuriata solum
vertisset exilii 631153, deinde plebs tributis
scisceret, id eijustum exilium esset '' (Wolf).
See Livy, 26. c. 3.

Klotz answers Niebuhr, who charges the
Declamator with saying that these three
men were condemned to exile by the Co·
mitia Centuriata; and he correctly main-
tains that this is not said here, but it is
said that the men were condemned for
something, and avoided the punishment
by going into exile, as they could do.
Niebuhr also says that ‘ exilium ' was never
inflicted as a punishment before the enact-
ment of the Lex Calpurnia de Ambitu3 but
‘exilium ' was no part of the penalty of the
Lex Calpurnia. Niebuhr also thinks that
the story of Ahala being recalled may be as
destitute of foundation as that of Kaeso.
To this Klotz replies that it is not said here
that they were recalled by the people in
the Comitia Centuriata, but ‘⁴ he only states
that they were restored to their former dig-
nity by the people, who were afterwards
reconciled to them.'’ Let it be so.
