To THE

ORATIO DE DOMO.

Dumna his tribuneship Clodius had consecrated the ground on which
Cicero’s house stood, or set it apart to religious uses, a thing which
had been done with the ground on which stood the houses of Sp.
Cassius, Sp. Maelius, and others (Livy, ii. 413 iv. 16). Cicero did not
consider himself fully reinstated in his former condition, unless the
ground was restored to him (Ad Att. iii. 20); Letter to Terentia, Ad
Fam. xiv. 2: “Quod de domo scribis, hoe est, de area, ego vero tum
denique mihi videbor restitutus, si illa nobis erit restituta ”). After his
return, and at the end of September B.c. 57, he made a great effort to
get this aot of consecration annulled by the authority of the Senate.
The matter was referred by the Senate to the College of Pontifices, and
Cicero made an elaborate speech before them on the matter, as he says

pius, who was praetor, to address the people, told them that the Ponti-
fices had given judgment in his favour3 that Cicero was going to take
forcible possession of the ground ; and 116 urged them to follow him and
Appius to the place and defend the Atrium of Libertas, which he had
erected on the site of Cicero’s house. Cicero resolved not to go to the
ground until the consuls, pursuant to a S. C., should enter into a con—
traet for rebuilding the Porticus of Catulus, which Clodius had demo-
lished together with Cicero’s house. On the second of October the
Senate came to this resolution: that the ground on which Cicero’s
house had stood should be restored to him; that a contraet should be
made for rebuilding the Porticus of Catulus, the proximity of Which
