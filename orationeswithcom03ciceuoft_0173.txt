PRO

P.

SULLA

ORATIO

AD JUDICES.

Ι. MAleE vellem, judices, ut P. Sulla et antea dignitatis suae
splendorem obtinere et post calamitatem acceptam modestiae
fructum aliquem potuisset percipere; sed quoniam ita tulit casus
infestus, ut amplissimo in honore quum communi ambitionis invidia
tum singulari Autronii odio everteretur, et in his pristinae fortunae
reliquiis miseris et afflictis tamen haberet quosdam, quorum animos
ne supplicio quidem suo satiare posset, quamquam ex hujus incom-
modis magnam animo molestiam capio, tamen in ceteris malis facile

patior oblatum mihi tempus esse,

in quo boni viri lenitatem meam

misericordiamque, notam quondam omnibus, nunc quasi intermissam,
agnoscerent, improbi ac perditi cives redomiti atque victi, praecipi-

amplissimo in honore] ‘et amplissimo
honore,' Halm, who connects it with ‘ ever-
teretur.' Thus Cicero says: “ ne per sum-
mam injuriam pupillum Junium fortunis
patriis conetur evertere ’⁷ (Verr. ii. l. c. 5l);
and Pro Flacco, c. 5, ‘fortunis eversos.’
Ernesti, according to Orelli, erased the ‘in.'
But I think it may stand, for as Sylvius
says, Sulla was ‘consul designatus’ when
he was convicted of bribery and ruined
(everte1·etur); and ‘everteretur' may be
used without the ablative, I suppose, as it
is in the active voice: “ Labefactarat enim
vehementer aratores jam superior annus,
proximus vero funditus everterat'’ (verr.
ii. 3. c. 18). Besides this, ‘amplissimo in

honore’ is opposed to ‘in his—reliquiis)
—‘ communi . . . invidiaz' “since hc was
ruined through the envy that attends all
persons who aspire to the honours of the
state, and through the bad repute in which
Autronius particularly was.’'

redomiti] This is said to be the only ex-
ample of this word, and to be the MSS.
reading. ⁴ Edomiti ' is printed in some edi-
tions. The proposal to write ‘re domiti'
is properly rejected by Halm and some pre-
vious editors. Forcellini has omitted‘re-
domiti! There is no more difficulty about
‘redomitus' than ‘revictus' (Hor., Carni.
iv. 4, 24, and the note in Macleane's edi-
tion). But I do not consider that the ‘re ’
has no meaning in ‘redomiti‚’ though Ι
suppose that ‘domiti ’ might have expressed
enough. They were tamed to obedience3
tamed and humbled after resistancm that
is the meaning of ‘ redomitus.'—‘ praecipi--
