228 ORAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

rum ac monumentorum aditus exornavit suorum. J am vero ille,
quicum Aetolis Ennio comite bellavit, Fulvius, non dubitavit
Martis manubias Musis consecrare. Quare in qua urbe impera-
tores prope armati poetarum nomen et Musarum delubra coluerunt,
in ea non debent togati judices a Musarum honore et a poetarum
salute abhorrere.

Atque ut id libentius faciatis, jam me vobis, judices, indicabo, et
de meo quodam amore gloriae, nimis acri fortasse, verum tamen
honesto, vobis confitebor. Nam quas res nos in consulatu nostro
vobiscum simul pro salute hujus [urbis atque] imperii et pro vita
civium proque universa re publica gessimus, attigit hic versibus
atque inchoavit, quibus auditis, quod mihi magna res et jucunda
visa est, hunc ad perficiendum hortatus sum. Nullam enim virtus
aliam mercedem laborum periculorumque desiderat praeter hanc
laudis et gloriae3 qua quidem detracta, judices, quidest quod in
hoc tam exiguo vitae curriculo et tam brevi tantis nos in laboribus
exerceamus? Certe, si nihil animus praesentiret in posterum, et si
quibus regionibus vitae spatium circumscriptum est, eisdem omnes
cogitationes terminaret suas, nec tantis se laboribus frangeret,
neque tot curis vigiliisque angeretur, neque toties de ipsa vita dimi-
caret. N unc insidet quaedam in optimo quoque virtus, quae noctes
et dies‘ animum gloriae stimulis concitat atque admonet, non cum

Illusz's] Fulvius Nobilior, the Aetolian
conqueror, took away from Ambracia the
picture of the Muses by Zeuxis (Pliny, 35.
10), and placed it in the temple of the
Muses which he dedicated at Rome. Zeuxis
was the great painter of female beauty, and
Fulvius showed his taste and his love of
plunder too by carrying to Rome the
Muses of Zeuxis. We should like to know
how Zeuxis treated the subject of the
Muses, for it was one which required an
elevation of character, and Zeuxis' style was
not the ethic, but the pure representation
of beauty of form (Aristotle, Poetic, c. 15).

amore ylor·iae,] See c. 10, note.

hortatus suna] There are readings ‘ad-
oravi,’ ‘ adortavi,' and ⁴ hortavi.’ The Erf.
has ⁴ adhortatus sum,’ and A. has ‘hortatus
sum.' Halm has ‘adornavi‚’ which he ex-
plains, “I have furnished him with the
necessary materials from my (·ommentarii.”
‘Adornavi' is Klotz's alteration, as Baiter
says, who adopts it. Halm does not say
where he got it from. It is possible that
⁴ adoravi ' niay be intended for ‘ adornavi ς’
but the MSS. authority seems rather for
‘ hortatus ’ or ⁴ adhortatus!

virtus aliam merc-edem] Merit has the
praise of men and glory for its reward.
Every thing must be paid for. Even ‘ vir-
tus' must be paid for being ‘ virtus.’ Aris-
totle makes honour the reward of merit
(ἀρετ-ως and it is given, he says, to the
good. He forgot that it is often given to
the bad. Such is the nature of human
affairs that praise, honour, glory, or what-
ever else there is, are given to the good and
to the bad; not always given to the good
as being good, and certainly not given to
the bad as bad, but for some other reason.
In the nature of things, then, honour and
glory are not the reward of gooduess at all;
and the notion of reward sor virtue is a de-
lusion. There is more truth in the saying
written in our old copy books, “ Virtue is
its own reward,⁷’ and often all that it gets,
sometimes all that. it can get, in the present
state of popular morality.

praesentiret in posterum] He has the
same expression and the same idea in the
oration Pro C. Rabirio, c. 10: “optimi et
sapientissimi cujusque animus ita praesentit
in posterum ut nihil nisi sempiternum spec-
tare videatur.”
