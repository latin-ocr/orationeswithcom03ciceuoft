convertere. XXV. Omnibus in rebus, judices, quae graviores
majoresque sunt, quid quisque voluerit, cogitarit, admiserit, non ex
crimine, sed ex moribus ejus qui arguitur, est ponderandum. Neque
enim potest quisquam nostrum subito fingi, neque cujusquam repente
vita mutari aut natura converti. Circumspicite paullisper menti-
bus vestris, ut alia mittamus, hosce ipsos homines qui huic affines
sceleri fuerunt. Catilina contra rem publicam conjuravit. Cujus
aures umquam haec respuerunt conatum esse hominem a pueritia
non 50111111 intemperantia et scelere, sed etiam consuetudine et studio
in omni flagitio, stupro, caede versatum? Quis eum contra patriam
pugnantem periisse miratur, quem semper omnes ad. civile latro-
cinium natum putaverunt? Quis Lentuli societates cum indicibus,
quis insaniam libidinum, quis perversam atque impiam religionem
recordatur, qui illum aut nefarie cogitasse aut stulte sperasse mire-

tur?

Quis de C. Cethego atque ejus 111 Hispaniam profectione, ac

de vulnere Q. Metelli Pii cogitat, cui non ad illius poenam carcer

aedificatus esse videatur?

25. non ex crimine] The remark is
good. When a man is charged with a
thing, we ask for the evidence to prove it.
If there 15 110 evidence, oris we form any
opinion before the evidence is produced, we
must not allow the charge to 110 1110 11103-
sure of what the man may have designed,
thought, or done, but we must form our
probable judgment from the man’s charac-
ter. Cirero says (Pro Cluentio, c. 25):
“perinde ut opinio cst de cujusque mori-
bus, ita quid ab eo factum aut 11011 factum
sit, existimari potest.'’ It is true that a
large part of mankind take the fact of the
charge 35 3 probability 011 the side of guilt.
If the charge is made by an honest man,
we may assume that he believes it to be
true. Still it must be proved. If the cha-
racter of the man who makes the charge is
bad, and the character of the accus-cd 15
good. the presumption should be that the
charge is false. The Romans allowed the
examination of slaves by torture in many
03505, but they made an exception which
was just: “ In ea caussa in qua nullis reus
argumentis urgebatur, tormenta non facile
adhibenda sunt, sed instandum accusatori
ut id quod intendit comprobet atque con-
vincat” (Paulus, Dig. 48. 18. 18. ξ 2).

hominem] ‘Audacter hominem a pueri-
tia,’ Halm; the reading of the MSS„ but
‘audacter' is only in T. The common
editions have ‘usque a mennas—‘caede
versatum) The Erfurt MS. has ‘grassa-

VOL. ΙΙΙ.

Omitto ceteros, ne sit infinitum.

Tan-

tum‚' but Orelli says that Cicero never uses
‘grassari‚’ and he refers to the oration Pro
Sex. Roscio Am. 0. 52: “quae hoc tem-
pore in re publica versata est;'’ and 1115
note there.

indic-ibus‚] ‘ Informers‚' false men who
lied to ruin others. In the oration Pro
Murena (c. 24), Catilina is said to have
been ‘⁶ vallatus indicibus et sicariis.’' The
‘ impia religio ' 15 explained by the passage
in the oration In Cat. iii. c. 4, where we are
told that Lentulus had consulted the Sibyl-
line books and the haruspices. When the
books and the haruspices were properly
eousulted, it was an act of ‘ religio,’ but it
was wicked when Lentulus did it, because
the purpose was wicked. This will help to
explain ⁴ dc scelere‚⁷ c. lo.

Metelli Pii] He carried on the war in
Spain against Sertorius. Nothing more is
known about his being wounded by Cethe-
gus; but we may infer that Cethegus had
attempted to assassinate Pius sometime and
somewhere. Drumann conjectures that
Cethegus had accompanied Metellus to
Spain to learn 1110 art of war in the 03111-
paigns against sorim-ius. Sylvius had made
1110531110 guess long ago. Halm approves
of Drumann's conjecture3 but 110 adds that
Cicero expresses himself in such 1011115 that
we may refer them to a journey made pur-
posely to commit 311 assassination. This
is the way of some 0111105. They talk about
facts without any evidence for them.
