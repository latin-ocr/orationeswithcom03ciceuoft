ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

hominem

veneno apertissime sustulit3 emit domum licitatoribus defatigatis

prope dimidio carius quam aestimabat.

Quorsum igitur haec oratio

pertinet? Domus illa mea prope tota vacua est: vix pars aedium

mearum decima ad Catuli porticum accessit.

licitatoribus] Pantagathus: the MSS.
readings are ‘litigatoribus‚’ ‘ligatoribus,’
and ‘litigationibus.'-⁴aestimabatur,' Ga-
ratoni, Baiter: “aestimabat cuin signo in-
terpunctionis compendio syllabae ur simil-
limo, P.; aestimabat G. M. V.” (Baiter.)

prope vacua . . . decima] Becker (Hand-
buch, &c vol. i. p. 423): “After M. Ful-
vius Flaccus had perished with C. Gracchus,
his house on the Palatine was pulled down,
and his kinsman Q. Lutatius Catulus at a
later time, after his victory over the Cimbri,
built on the site the Porticus Catuli. Close
to it stood the house of Cicero, which had
been built by M. Livius Drusus, and after-
wards belonged to a Crassus, but it certainly
was not the house which L. Crassus the
orator had once possessed, whose extrava-
gant splendour, as it then was judged to be,
was made a cause of reproach against him.
&Vlien Cicero was banished, Clodius set fire
to this house and added a part of it to the
Porticus Catuli3 but by much the largest
part, though he dedicated it to Libertas,
he joined to the house which he bought
there at the same time.” Becker refers to
Plutarch, Cicero, c. 333 Dion Cassius, 38.
c. 173 Appian, B. C. ii. 153 Cicero, In
Pison. ll with the note of Asconius, and
generally to this speech De Domo, and
particularly to this chapter (44). He adds:
‘¹ Clodius erased the name of Catulus and
dedicated the Porticus under his own name’¹
(De Domo, c. 533 De Har-usp. c. 27).
Here the Declamator says: “ that house of
mine is almost entirely vacant‚” meaning
by the house the area of the house; and
“scarcely a tenth part of my house (he
means the area) has been added to the
Porticus Catuli.'' It was ‘vacua religione ⁷
(De Harusp. c. G). “The reason (of this)
was the ‘ambulatio’ and ‘monumentum ’
and that Libertas of Tanagra, when ‘liber-
tas' was crushed.'' The ‘ ambulatio ’ was a
place to wall< about in (Pro Sulla, c. 21).
Manutius says: ‘⁴ the ‘ambulatio’ made by
Claudius was the reason why scarcely a
tenth part of my house was added to the
Porticus.’' He took the greater partos the
area for his own use.

He explains the facts thus: “Clodius
had destroyed the Porticus of Catulus and
had built there another Porticus (clarissimi

Caussa fuit ambula-

viri mortui monumenta delebat, c. 38)st
Then he adds, “ Hanc vero in Palatio atque
in pulcherrimo urbis loco porticum esse pa-
tiemini?’' (c. 39.) Accordingly he calls
the Porticus Catuli, not that which then
was, but that which had been, on the site
of which and of a part of Cicero’s house
Clodius had built a Porticus of three hun-
dred feet.

Markland quotes a long note of Ferratius
on this passage. Ferratius says: “The
house of Q. Seius was next to the house of
Clodius, for otherwise Clodius could not
have stopped his windows (lumina) by build-
ing. Behind the house of Seius was the
Porticus Catuli, and Cicero’s house joined
the same Porticus on the other side. Ac-
cordingly Clodius pulled down the ‘monu-
mentum’ of Catulus and also a partos
Cicero's house, and having plenty of room
he built a new Porticus, and dedicated it to
Libertas.'' This makes it plain how Clo-
dius united ‘ duas et magnas et nobiles do-
mos,' the house of Seius and the house of
Tullius. Ferratius then explains ‘prope
tota vacuaz' “the area of Cicero's house
was not dedicated, for ‘vix pars aedium
mearum decima ad Catuli porticum accessit.'
This was the only part which was dedi-
cated, and it was about this part only that
the Pontifices had to give judgment; for
the rest of the house (the area), which
Clodius had bought in another man’s name
and had assigned part of it to the Clodia
gens, was not dedicated and would be re·—
stored as a matter of course. Accordingly
Cicero proceeds to say ‘ Causa fuit ambu-
latio,’ διο. Clodius had no thought of a
dedication to the purposes of religion: he
wished to occupy my house, and to join it
to the house of Seius 3 yet he added a part
to the Porticus Catuli for two reasons, that
my house appear-ing to be consecrated to
Libertas might not be restored to me by
the Senate, and that he might have a larger
Porticus to walk about iu. Accordingly
the Pontifices are said to have given judg-
ment about Cicero’s house in these terms
(Ad Att. iv. 2) ; ⁶ Videri posse sine religione
[eam] (Orelli) partem areae mihi restitui!
Why not the whole area? Because only a
tenth part of the house had been dedicated
and almost the whole house was ‘a religione
