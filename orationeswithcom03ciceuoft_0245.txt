ORATION FOR L. VALERIUS FLACCUS.

L. VALERIUS FLACCUS was the son of L. Valerius Flaccus, who was the
colleague of C. Marius in his sixth consulship (13.0. 100), and assisted
in stopping the riots of Saturninus (Pro C. Rabirio, c. 10, Vol. IL).
Flaccus, the father, was the man who proposed the Lex-Valeria for the
relief of debtors at the expense of creditors (Pro Fonteio, c. 1, Vol. IL).
In Bo 86 Flaccus was appointed consul in the place of C. Marius who
had just died, and he went at the head of an army into Asia, where he
was murdered by C. Flavius Fimbria, his own legatus.

L. Valerius Flaccus the son served as tribunus militum in Cilicia
under P. Servilius in B.o. 7 8, and afterwards in Spain as quaestor under
M. Calpurnius Piso (Pro Flacco, c. 3). He also served in Achaia and
in Gallia (c. 26). In B.c. 63, the year of Cicero’s consulship, he was a
praetor, and he and C. Pomptinus arrested the Allobroges at the Pons
Mulvius (Introduction to the orations against Catilina). 11] the next
year he was the governor of the Province Asia, in which government
he succeeded P. Servilius Globulus, and he was succeeded in Rc. 61 by
Q. Cicero, the brother of Marcus. In Ro. 59 Flaccus was prosecuted on
the charge of Repetundae, the usual charge against a Roman provincial
governor. The prosecutor was Decimus Laelius, and the subscriptores
were Lucceius, Appuleius Decianus, and L. Balbus (Schol. Bob. p. 228,
ed. Orelli3 Pro Flacco, c. 33). Laelius had taken great pains in collect-
ing evidence in Asia against Flaccus, as Cicero had collected evidence in
Sicily against Verres (Pro Flacco, e. 5, 6). The Praetor who presided
at the trial was T. Vettius, and among the Judices there were L.
Lucullus and L. Peducaeus (Pro Flacco, 0. 28, 34). The guilt of
Flaccus, if he was guilty, was perhaps not the only reason or the chief
reason for the prosecution. Flaccus had boen active against the accom-
pliccs of Catilina in 13.c. 63, and the remnants of that faction were ready
to attack both Cicero and all his adherents. Cicero therefore had good
