252 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

multi orae maritimae clarissimi viri praefuerunt, qui quum prae-
donem nullum cepissent mare tamen tutum praestiterunt? Casus
est enim in capiendo, locus, eventus, occasio: defendendi facilis est
cantic, non solum latibulis occultorum locorum, sed etiam tempes-
tatum moderatione et conversione. XIV. Reliquum est 111111136-

Asia, bipartito classem distributam fuisse ut una pars supra Ephe-

amplissimus, ab Aeno in Asiam, his navibus Flaccus ex Asia in Mace-

was really equipped and sailed 011 1116 sea,
or was only paid for and existed in name.
We see from what follows how the 11661 was
employed. It conveyed M. Crassus, ‘vir
amplissimus,’ from Aenus on the coast of
Thrace into Asia. This was M. Crassus,
the rich, the man who afterwards perished
in Mesopotamia. Plutarch (Pompeius, c.
43) says that when Pompeius was return-
ing victorious from the East, and people
were expecting that “a monarchy would be
firmly established, Crassus taking his sons
and his money secretly got away from
Rome, whether it was that he was really
afraid, or, what is more probable, he wished
to give credibility to the calumny and to
strengthen the odium against Pompeius.'’
Crassus went abroad as a private person,
but so great a man could have the use of a
provincial fleet. In modern times per-ty
princes sometimes sail at other people's eost
in the vessels of another state. There is no
connexion intended between the voyage of
Flaccus and that of Crassus. Cicero merely
wishes to prove that there was a fleet, which
Crassus used, and Flaccus went to Macedo-
nia in.

L. Sullae descriptioni] This is the
arrangement which Sulla made when he
entered Asia n.c. 84 (Vol. Il. THE Pno-
erCE AsiA). Cicero says in the letter to
his brother Quintus : ‘⁴ Nomen autem pub-
licani aspernari non possunt, qui pendere
ipsi vectigal sine publicano non potuerunt,
quod iis aequaliter Sulla descripserat’'

(Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. ll).

pro portione] κατὰ λόγον, 35 1116
Greeks say. The ‘ summa,’ the amount of
the money, was not yet made up. Faer-
nus says that some MSS. have ‘in pro-
vinciis! Six Lagomarsini MSS. and three
Oxford have ‘ in provincia! S. T. A. F. have
‘in provincias‚’ which nobody has been able
to explain. Graevius had no doubt that
‘in provincia’ was the reading, unless we
should erase ‘ in provincias‚’ which Momm-
sen also, as Baiter says, supposes to be a
glossema. But the true expression is ‘ descri-
bere pecuniam,' not ‘ describere civitates 3'
and the text cannot be considered as restored.
Lambinus. who proposed to read ‘ qui quum
in omnes Asiae civitates pro portione pecu-
niam descripsisset,' saw the meaning.

Faernus has the following note on ‘de-
scripsisset :’ ‘⁴ unus liber pro descripsisset,
dixerim-isset .· quod verbum usurpat Teren-
tius in Phormione:

ι 9311111ιέ6 116-ἕο discripsi porro illis quibus
e 111.

nam ita in antiquis legitur et Donato.’'
The reading is now ‘perscripsi’ in some
editions of Terence (Phormio, v. 7), but
others have ‘discripsi.’ Baiter makes no
mention of the reading ‘discripsisset' in
Cicero. The editors have resolved to de-
stroy this word; and yet it ought to be
restored in many passages. But Iseldom
find any trace of its existence in the various

readings which they give (See Vol. I. Index,
⁴ Discribere ’).
