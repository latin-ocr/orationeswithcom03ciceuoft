neque procreare jam liberos possit, et quum potuerit sit expertus.
Quae deinde caussa cuique sit adoptionis, quae ratio generum ac
dignitatis, quae sacrorum, quaeri a pontificum collegio solet. Quid
est horum in ista, adoptione quaesitum? Adoptat annos viginti
natus, etiam minor, senatorem. Liberorumne caussa? At pro-
creare potest. Habet- uxorem: suscipiet jam liberos. Exhere-
dabit igitur pater filium. Quid, sacra Clodiae gentis cur intereunt
quod in te est? quae omnis notio pontificum quum adoptarere esse
debuit; nisi forte ex te ita quaesitum est, num perturbare rem
publicam seditionibus velles, et ob eam caussam adoptari, non
ut ejus filius esses, sed ut tribunus plebis fieres et funditus everteres
civitatem. Respondisti, credo, te ita velle. Pontificibus bona
caussa visa est: approbaverunt. Non aetas ejus qui adoptabat
est quaesita, ut in Cn. Aufidio, M. Pupio, quorum uterque nostra
memoria, summa senectute, alter Oresten, alter Pisonem adoptavit3
quas adoptiones, sicut alias innumerabiles, hereditates nominis,

&c.). This adoption of Clodius was an
‘adrogatim’ “Populi auctoritate adopta-
mus eos qui sui juris sunt: quae species
adoptionis dicitur adrogatio, quia et is qui
adoptat rogatur, id est, interrogatur an velit
eum quem adoptaturus sit justum sibi filium
esse3 et is qui adoptatur rogatur an id fieri
patiatur, et populus rogatur au id fieri
jubeat.'' The ⁴ adrogatio’ was effected by a
Lex Curiata, as Cicero says (Pro Sestio,
c. 7). There is a chapter in Gellius (v, 19)
on adoption. He says of the ‘adrogatioz’
“sed adrogationes non temere nec inex-
plorate committuntur. Nam comitia arbi-
tris Pontificibus praebentur, quae Curiata
appellantur3 aetasque ejus qui adrogare
vult, an liberis potius gignendis idonea sit,
bonaque ejus qui arrogatur ne insidiose ap-
petita sint consideratur: jusquejurandum
a Q. Mucio pontifice maximo conceptum
dicitur quod in adrogando juraretur.’'

puts a note of interrogation after it. Itis
not material. The new father of Clodius
will beget children. ⁴ Accordingly the father
will exheredato the son,' that is, Clodius.
Hotmann takes this to be the answer of
Clodius, and ‘exheredare’ to mean ‘ eman-
cipare.' He is mistaken in the second part
of his supposition at least.

Cicero says, ‘⁶ well, the ‘sacra' of the
Clodia gens, why do they pei-ish, so far as
is in you ?'' This is not immediately con-

nected with what precedes: it touches the
whole question of adoption.

There are some remarks on the Sacra in
the notes to the oration Pro Murena, c. 12.
The passages about the Sacra are in Cicero,
De Legibus ii. 19, 21. These passages
state that the obligation of the Sacra was
attached to the property (pecunia), and the
maintenance of the Sacra was a duty im-
posed on the person to whom the property
came (sacra cum pecunia conjuncta sunt).
The effect of ‘ adrogatio ' was to make the
adrogated person the son of the adoptive
father, who acquired ‘per universitatem’
the property of the new child. If Clodius
was the last of his gens, the name would
have been extinct by his adoption 3 but I sup-
pose that the obligation of the Sacra would
be attached to the property. They perish‚
says Manutius, because when you are adopt-
ed by Fonteius, you pass over to the Sacra
of the Fonteia gens, It is true that the
adopted son passed into the Familia and
Sacra of his new father, but that will not
explain why the Sacra of his former gens
are lost, if the Sacra are attached to the
property.

omnis notio] ‘Notio’ is the same· as ‘ cog-
nitio’ (e. 12), and Cicero has used ‘notio'
in this way.

Orestem] Cn. Aufidius Orestes got this
name by being adopted by Cn. Aufidius,
for before his adoption he belonged to
the Gens Aurelia. Orestes was consul
B.c. 71, with P. Lentulus Sura.
