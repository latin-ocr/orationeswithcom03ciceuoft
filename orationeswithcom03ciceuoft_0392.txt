378 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

esset aliquid modestiae, cujusquam tibi potestas fuit; neque tu
legum scriptoribus iisdem potuisti uti quibus ceteri neque operum
architectis; neque pontificem adhibere quem velles: postremo ne
in praedae quidem societate mancipem aut praedae socium extra
tuorum gladiatorum numerum, aut denique suffragii latorem in ista
tua proscriptione quemquam nisi furem ac sicarium reperire
potuisti.

XIX. Itaque quum tu florens ac potens per medium scortum
populare velitares, amici illi tui te uno amico tecti et beati, qui se
populo commiserant, ita repellebantur ut etiam Palatinam tuam
perderent3 qui in judicium venerant, sive accusatores erant sive
rei, te deprecante damnabantur. Denique etiam ille novitius Ligur,
venalis ascriptor et subscriptor tuus, quum M. Papirii sui fratris
esset testamento et judicio improbatus, mortem ejus se velle per-
sequi dixit: nomen SeX. Propertii detulit. Accusare alienae
dominationis scelerisque socius propter calumniae metum non est
ausus. De hac igitur lege dicimus quae jure rogata videatur;

tomed to read Cicero, will find all this very
obscure. Ligur was passed over (praeteritus,
praetermissus) in his brother's will, which
was discreditable to him (Pro P. Quintio,
c. 4. Vol. ΙΙ.). Ligur said that he would
avenge his brother's death: he brought a

cium Pl: ‘mancipem aut praedem extra‚'
Garatoni, followed by Baiter. Manutius
suggested ‘ praedem, socium.' The ‘ man-
ceps' is the purchaser at the sale, and he
who takes the ¹ publica ' on lease from the

Censors. The ⁴ praes' was he who joined
as security (fidejussor).

Pithoeus and Graevius proposed ⁴ sec-
tione’ (sectio, a public sale3 sector) for
‘societates Garatoni also would like to
have ‘ sectione! And all this to mend what
does not want mending ε “ not even in the
partnership in booty could you find a ‘ man-
ceps’ or a partner in your booty out of,”
&c. Very true that it is not Cieeronian,
nor is it sense; but it is like the rest.

19. per medium] ‘ Per medium forum
scortum populare ' Lambinus, Baiter. ‘Per
medium cohortis popularis’ is the common
reading in the printed books.

qui se populo commiserant‚] This is ex-
plained to mean who were candidates for
the ⁴ honores' in the Comitia. There is an
allusion to Vatinius, who was a candidate
for the aedileship and was rejected. The
Palatina is the ‘tribus Palatina‚' of which
they lost the votes. It contained many of
the rabble, the ‘operae’ of Clodius (Pro
Sestio, c. 53): “ tribum suam non tulit, Pala-
tinam denique‚ per quam omnes illae pestes
vexare rem publicam dicebantur perdidit.''

novitius Liyur, . . . discessit] Ligur is
Sex. Aelius, tribunus pl„ who assumed the
cognomen Ligur. A man who is accus-

charge of murdering his brother against
Sex. Propertius (nomen detulit). But he
did not venture to prosecute the charge for
fear of involving himself in a prosecution
sor ⁶ calumnia‚' for making a malicious
charge. Markland could see no sense in
‘damnationis 5061113,ι for so it is generally
read. But ‘dominationis ' is the MSS.
reading, and it is adopted by Baiter. There
is also a reading ⁴ socios! Klotz says that
Gesner has excellently illuminated this pas-
sage. Gesner says of Ligur, “ Ipsam tamen
accusationem ingredi non est ausus: cur?
Propter metum, ne, si non probaret crimen,
calumniae damnaretur. Unde autem ille
metus? Quia socius erat damnationis in-
justae ac sceleris in Ciceronem et patriam
commissi, propter quod se injustum et sus-
pectum sentiret.’' Markland could not see
how Propertius could be called ‘ damnationis
socius,' when in the same sentence it is said
that he was very far from the danger of a
‘ damnatio,’ since he gave up the prosecu-
tion. But Gesner has made it all plain.
He could understand any thing.

De hae leqe . . . vide-atum] He means
the Lex of Clodius directed against Cicero,
a Lex ‘ quae jure rogata videatur‚' which is

rather obscure. “ Of this Lex whoever
