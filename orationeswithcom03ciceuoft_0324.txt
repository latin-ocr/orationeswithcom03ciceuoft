310 ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

tune ausus esisto oculo, non dicam isto animo, ista fronte, non vita,
tanto supercilio, non enim possum dicere tantis rebus gestis, ,cum
A, Gabinio consociare consilia pestis mean Non te illius unguen-
torum odor, non vini anhelitus, non frons calamistri notata vestigiis,
in eam cogitationem adducebat, ut, quum illius re similis fuisses,
frontis tibi integumento ad occultanda tanta flagitia diutius uti
non liceret? Oum hoc tu coire ausus es ut consularem dignitatem,
ut rei publicae statum, ut senatus auctoritatem, ut civis optime
meriti fortunas provinciarum foedere addiceres? Te consule, tuis
edictis et imperiis senatui populi Romani non est licitum, non
modo sententiis atque auctoritate sua, sed ne luctu quidem ac
vestitu rei publicae subvenire. Capuaene te putabas, in qua urbe
domicilium quondam superbiae fuit, consulem esse, sicut eras eo
tempore, an Romae, in qua civitate omnes ante vos consules senatui
paruerunt? Tu es ausus in Circo Flaminio productus cum tuo illo
pari dicere, te semper misericordem fuisse? quo verbo senatum
atque omnes bonos tum quum a patria pestem depellerent crudeles
demonstrabas fuisse. Tu misericors 1ne affinem tumn, quem
comitiis tuis praerogativae primum custodem praefeceras, quem

“The form of the sentence,’' says Wolf,
‘⁶ deceived Gesner, the form being Cicero-
nian enough, and we only want good sense

origin of the expression.
The words ‘ sicut eras eo tempore ’ mean
that he was a consul at Capua. Piso was a

in it expressed in words suitable to the oc-
casion.'' This is the defect.

calamistri] I do not know if this needs
to be explained. Hotniann has explained
it. The friseur had accidentally burned the
worthy consul’s forehead when he was curl-
ing his hair. It must have been a bad
burn and a clumsy friseur to make a marl<
that lasted so long; or perhaps more marks
than one. See in Pison. c. 6: “qui istius
insignem nequitiam frontis involutam inte-
gumentis nondum cernat.''

addiceres ³⁷] This is a technical word sig-
nifying to assign to Clodius as a purchaser
the property of Cicero, by virtue of the
agreement about the provinces—‘tuis edic-
tis? that is common, but ‘tuis imperiis'
is n0t3 yet it is Latin. But whether it
could bc said of a consul as it is said here,
in conjunction with ‘edictis,' I do not
know. The plural ⁴ imperia’ is said of the
powers which the state gave3 and is pro-
perly used at the end of this chapter, ‘ pro-
vinciae, legiones, imperia ‹lonabantur.’

Capuaene] Capua was once the ¹ domi-
cilium superbiae' as he calls it. A passage
in the oration De Inflare Agraria, i. ι’. (i,
will explain this (Vol. ΙΙ ); and show the

Dunmvir at Capua in the same year in
which he was consul at Rome (Pro Sestio,
c. 8). Markland thinks that this passage
proves the ignorance of the writer of this
speech, who affirms that Piso was a consul
at Capua. Gesner, a good-natured man,
but deficient in judgnient, as Wolf thinks,
says of Markland, ‘· vir alias perspicax non
vidit amaram hic irrisionem esse.’' It re-
quires a sharp eye to see the ‘ amara irri-
sio ;' and an Englishman would find that
out as quick as a German. so says Wolf:
“ Sin vero de gustu ironiae quaeritur, ne
Marklandus quidem, opinor, sine sapore
erat, aut nesciebat, utpote Britannus, quid
bona irrisio esset : qnod autem ille dicit, ex
animi dicit sententia.” Garatoni proposes
to leave ont the words, and so settle the
dispute3 which is certainly ingenious, but
not just. Cicero himself (In Pison. c. ll)
calls him ‘Campanus consul‚’ but itis a
very different thing there from what is said
here. Even in the De Domo, c. 23, it is
quite different.

comitiis luis] Cicero says In Pison. c.
5: “Cui primam comitiis tuis dederas ta-
bulam praerogativae, quem in Senatu sen-
tentiam rogabas tertium-'⁷
