ORATIO HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS. 431

Garatoni endeavoured to fix the place which this oration must occupy
among the several which Cicero delivered in this year (Ro. 56), and he
supposes that it was delivered before the orations Pro Sestio, In Vati-
nium, Pro Caelio, and after the orations De Provinciis Consularibus and

ν Pro Balbo.

Wolf concludes thus:

“ Pauci, opinor, jam erunt lectores quibus non ubique hic Cicero
aniliter garrire et vel ipsa illa Romanorum qui dicuntur vatum Latinitas
inepta, puerilis et parum Latina esse videaturff’

This speech is edited by Baiter in the second edition of Orelli’s Cicero,
The following are the MSS. to which he refers :—
P z Cod. Parisinus num. 7794 ab Halmio collatus.
Gr z Cod. Gemblacensis, nunc Bruxellensis, num. 5345 a me col-
latus.
E z Cod. Erfurtensis, nunc Berolinensis.
M Ξ Cod. Mediceus Plut. xlviii. cod. 25.

C Ξ Codices nostri omnes.

Klotz in his notes to this speech has, I think, attempted to answer
more of Wolf’s objections than iu his notes to the three other spurious
speeches. If I am not mistaken, he thinks this speech at least as good
as the others, or better. Ι have given all his answers which seemed to
me to be of any value, either as a defenee of the orator or as evidence of
the orator’s merit.

My first opinion of these speeches is confirmed by a more intimate
acquaintance with them. In their present form they are not the work
of Cicer-03 and they are the work of a man without understauding.
The language is certainly sometimes incorrect3 the sense and the style
generally most absurd. But as to particular expressions, it is possible
that some which have been supposed to be false Latin may still be
Latin3 and I am the more careful to make this admission, because I do
not assume that I possess such a knowledge of the language as‘ to pass
an infallible judgment in this matter. There are indeed very few men
at the present day who have this knowledge. With this reservation, I
pronounce this to be a most absurd stupid piece of talk, the worst of all
these four spurious speeches which pass under Cicero's name.
