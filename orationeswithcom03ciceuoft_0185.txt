OAP. 9, 10. 171

Res enim gestae, credo, meae me nimis extulerunt 30 1111111 nescio
quos spiritus attulerunt. Quibus de rebus tam claris, tam immor-
talibus, judiees, 1100 possum dicere, me, qui ex summis eripuerim
periculis urbem 113110 01 vitam omnium civium, satis adeptum foro,
si ex hoc tanto in 01111105 mortales beneficio nullum in me periculum
redundarit. Etenim in qua civitate res tantas gesserim, memini ;
111 qua urbe verser, intelligo. Plenum forum est eorum 11011111111111,
quos ego a vestris cervicibus depuli, judices, a 111015 11011 removi;
nisi vero paucos fuisse arbitramini, qui conari aut sperare possent
se tantum imperium posse delere. Horum ego faces eripere de
manibus et gladios extorquere potui, sicut feci: voluntates vero
conscelerata-s ac nefarias nec sanare potui 1100 tollere. Quare non
sum nescius quanto periculo vivam in tanta multitudine improbo-
rum, quum 1111111 11111 011111 omnibus improbis aeternum videam bellum
esse susceptum. X. Quod si illis meis praesidiis forte invides, et
si ea tibi regia videntur, quod omnes boni omnium generum atque
ordinum suam salutem 011111 11103 conjungunt3 consolare te, quod
omnium mentes improborum mihi uni maxime sunt infensae et
adversae3 qui 1110 11011 50111111 idcirco oderunt quod eorum conatus
impios et furorem consceleratum repressi, sed eo etiam magis quod
nihil jam se simile me vivo conari posse arbitrantur. At vero quid
ego mirer, si quid ab improbis de me improbe dicitur, quum L.
Torquatus primum ipse his fundamentis adolescentiae jactis, ea spe
says (De Legg. iii. 14) “si velis replicare ers may prefer ‘iis‚' because ‘ea spe' sol-

memoriam temporum.'’ The ‘domesticae lows; but that is my reason for preferring
imagines' is an allusion to the Manlii. M. ¹his,' which is emphatic, and points to

Manlius Capitolinus was put to death for
treason‚ for attempting‚ or being supposed
to be attemptinfz to usurp royal power.
The story is in Livy, (6. c. 20): “Gentis
Manliae decreto cautum est, ne quis deinde
M. Manlius vocaretur.” See Pro Domo, c.

cervicibus] This word is often used in
the plural, in various 5011505, 35 Verr. ii. 3.
c. 59; 5, 0. 423 Terence, Haut. ii. 3. 131:

“ Inversa verba, eversas cervices tuas.'’

aeternum—bellum] Compare In Cat. iv.
c. 10, ‘ aeternunrbellumss and the note.

10. primum ipse—exaudire] Halm
placed ⁴ ipse’ after ‘ fundamentis’ in his
small edition, but he has set it right in 1110
larger. Ernesti placed ‘ipse' before. ‘pri-
mum.' Halm has ¹ 115 fundamentis,' which he
explains by ⁴ talibus, tam bonis.’ These two
words *hi' and ‘ii’ are continually 0011-
founded. and it is often very difficult to
0110050 between them. Perhaps many read-

Torquatus who is present, to all his quali-
1105, even his personal qualities. Resides
this, all the MSS. have ‘his‚' except 0110,
which 1135 ‘hisce3' and here, as in many
other instances, the MSS. reading is that
which the sense requires.

Halm is still wrong about ‘exaudire’ It
seems as if he knew that he was wrong- and
tries to explain away what he had said (In
Cat. i. c. 8; iv. c. 7). He correctly ex-
plains ‘tantummodo ut‚’ ‘just loud enough3’
but Manutius gives the complete meaning:
“ non ut eos qui circum judicium stabant.''
Yet Halm says that ‘ exaudire’ means ‘ganz,
deutlich 11111·οΫ No doubt the judices did
hear, but they only just heard, as Halm
himself has 53111, 31111 35 Manutius truly
says, nobody else could hear. This 111011
15 not an instance in which ‘exaudire ' can
be translated ‘to hear 01031111ς1 11 means
‘just hear‚' and no more. llalm’s remark
is partly true and partly false z ‘⁴ The word
(exaudire) is generally used in such combi-
