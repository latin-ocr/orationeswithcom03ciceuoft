INTRODUCTION

TO THE

ORATION FOR P. SESTIUS.

P. SESTIUS was a member of the Collegium tribunorum in Rc. 57 in
the consulship of P. Lentulus Spinther and Q. Metellus Nepos, and
one of those who were most active in getting Cicero recalled to Rome.
Clodius was determined to prevent: Cicero's recall, if he could. He got
people together for riotous purposes, and in one of these broils P. Sestius
was dangerously wounded (Pro Sestio, c. 373 Ad Q. Fr. ii. 3). Sestius,
following the example of T. Annius Milo, also one of Cicero's friends,
collected a body of gladiators to protect him in his future attempts on
Cicero’s behalf. After Cicero's return Sestius was prosecuted under
the Lex Plautia de Vi, in the consulship of Cn. Cornelius Lentulus
Marcellinus and L. Marcius Philippus, 13.c. 56. The Scholiast says that
P. Clodius “began to prosecute Sestius de vi by urging against him as
chief in the management of the indictment P. Albinovanus, and P.
Vatinius gave evidence against him.'’ This Albinovanus is named M.
Tullius in a letter of Cicero to his brother (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 3). We learn
from another passage of Cicero (In Vatin. c. 1) that Vatinius not only

μ gave evidence against Sestius, but also communicated to Albinovanus

some harangues in writing made by Sestius before the people. L. Aemi-
lius Paullus and L. Gellius Poplicola also gave evidence against Sestius
(Pro Sestio, c. 5I; In Vatin. c. 2).

The principal charge against Sestius was that having gone beyond the
limits allowed by law, he had not carried his Rogatio for Cicero's resto-
rati0n by persuading the people, but by force of arms. Manutius in his
Argumentum states that Sestius was tried for the bloody affray of the
VIII Kal. Febr. between his followers and those of Clodius. But
Ferratius shows from this oration that this is a great mistake. On the
VIII Kal. Febr. Q. Fabricius proposed the Rogatio, which was the occa-
sion of a fight (Pro Sestio, c. 35) ; but Sestius was not present on that
