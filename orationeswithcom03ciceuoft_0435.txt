mum, simulacrum Concordiae dedicare pontifices in templo inau-

LIV. At si, pontifices, neque is cui licuit, neque id quod fas
fuit dedicavit, quid me attinet jam illud tertium quod proposueram,
docere, non iis institutis ac verbis quibus caerimoniae postulant
dedicasse? Dixi a principio, nihil me de scientia vestra, nihil de
sacris, nihil de abscondito jure pontificum dicturum. Quae sunt
adhuc a me de jure dedicandi disputata, non sunt quaesita ex
occulto aliquo genere litterarum, sed sumpta de medio, ex rebus
palam per magistratus actis ad collegiumque delatis, ex senatus-
consulto, ex lege. Illa interiora jam vestra sunt, quid dici, quid

templo inauyurato] Hotmann observes
that it is well known that the Senate could
not meet except in an ‘inauguratus locus ;'
and therefore ‘inaugurato’ is superfluous.
But this writer is always superfluous. So in
c. 50 there is ‘ publica templa!

consecratam eam] ‘consecratam jam‚'
Baiter, which is better. The MSS. have
‘ eam.'

demerso populo] Clodius was the tem-
pest of the ‘ patria‚’ in which tempest the
Res Publica was wrecked in the darkness of
the storm. He has forgot to tell us what
the sea was, but there must have been a sea
or there could not have been a storin and
shipwreck. Clodius, ‘the storm, the tem-
pest of peace and quiet‚' when the state was
wrecked in darkness, the Roman people
drowned‚ the Senate kicked overboard (he
might have drowned them with the ‘ po-
pulus'), in the midst of this confusion,
Clodius pulled down, built up, and had his
name cut on the building that he erected
(for, as Wolf says, ‘tuum’ is wanted).
After this miserable staff, after this wreck

of the Res Publica, we are told that it was
not drowned but expelled with Cicero, as
he has told us before (Quum Senatui, c.
14). “Denique respublica, aliis locis ear-
terminata, nunc inscitius dicitur carere his
moenibus. Nam illud excusari posset col-
lato loco de provv. conss. c. 2'’ (Wolf).
The latter part of the sentence is corrupt.
The reading in the editions is ‘ ad equitum
notam,' to which the reading of G. M. V.
comes very near, ‘ ab (ob M.) equitum
notam doloris.’ After ⁴ ad equitum notam ⁹
the common editions have ‘ ad dolorem bo-
norum omnium.’ Clodius hated the ‘ equites,'
and wished to insuit them because they were
Cicero’s friends.

54. Dixi aprincipz‘0‚] c. 15.—‘ praecipi ι’
⁴ praere' P. : the other readings are ⁴ prae—
cipere ' and ‘ percipere! Halm would write
‘ praeire,’ and Mommsen ‘ praeberi.'

Coruncanii] Ti. Coruncanius, the first
plebeian who was Pontifex Maximus (Livy,
Epit. 18); and about B.c. 254. He was
learned in the Jus Pontificium and an
honourable man. (Cicero, Brutus, c. 14.)
