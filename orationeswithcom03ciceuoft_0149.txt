Cicero says any thing that suits his purpose,
whether it is matter of history, of laW, of
opinion3 and people should be on their
guard against citing him as authority for
that which he did not believe hlmself. In
one of his works (De Fin. iv. lv) he ad-
dresses Cato on the so-called Stoical Para-
doxa, and he cannot answer them. The
Dialectic of the Stoics was very hard to
deal with. The chapter is well worth read-
ing. He says ‘· in prima igitur constitutione
Zeno tuus a natura recessit3 quumque suni-
mum bonum posuisset in ingenii praestantia
quain virtutem vocamus, nec quidquam
aliud bonum esse dixisset, nisi quod esset
honestum, nec virtutem posse constare, si
in ceteris rebus esset quidquam quod aliud
alio melius esset aut pejus3 his propositis
tenuit prorsus consequentia.'’ Cicero ad-
mits that if Zeno's premises, or those which
he attributes to him are granted, his ron-
clusions cannot be disputed. He adds:
‘⁴ Recte dicis: negare enim non possum.
Sed ita falsa sunt ea quae consequuntur, ut
illa e quibus haec nata sunt vera esse non
possint. Docent enim nos, ut scis, dialectici,
si ea quae rem aliquam sequantur, falsa sint,
falsam illam ipsam esse quam sequantur.''
We must then deal with the premises of the
Stoics‚ and consider what is a ‘summum
bonum‚’ what is ‘ingenii praestantia,' what
is ‘ virtus‚' what is ‘ honestum‚’ and whether
‘virtus' has degrees‚ or vice 1135. If we
could suppose a man of perfect virtue, and
that he should fall into some vice, great or
small, his perfection is gone.

Montesquieu, who otten thinks very
justly‚ has this remark (Pensees diverses) :
“Les termes de beau, de bon, de noble, de
grand, de parfait, sont des attributs des
objets, lesquels sont relatifs aux etres qui
les considerent. Il faut bien se mettre ce
principe (13115 la tete3 il est l'eponge de
presque tous les prejuges: c'est le fleau de
la philosophie ancienne, de la physique
d’Aristote‚ de la metaphysique de Platon.’'

The doctrine (James ii. 10). ‘⁴ For who-
soever shall keep the whole law and yet
ofl'end in one point, he is guilty of all,'’
which might seem to contain a contradic-
tion, is explained by the verse which follows
quite as well as by any of the commentators,

and rather better. We may reasonably
assume that Zeno's logical conclusions,
which came directly from his premises,
were abused by many of his followers and
by pretenders to philosophy, and that Cicero
and Horace both knew that no sensible
Stoic maintained that all vices or crimes
are equal in a practical sense, though every
vice or crime is a deviation from the perfect
standard. Cicero has a great deal about
the Stoics in his writings, and if we were to
put it all together, we should see that he is
not very consistent. In one passage (De
Fin. ii. ll)he explains the Stoie moral doc-
trine well. The Finis of the Stoics is “to
be in harmony with Nature, and they mean
by this to live according to Virtue, that 15,
‘honeste ς’ and this they explain thus: to
live with the knowledge of the things which
happen according to Nature, selecting those
things which are according to Nature and
rejecting the contrary.” If the term Nature
is truly understood, there is nothing in this
doctrine that can be denied by any person.
The Stoic doctrine of the Roman emperor
elevated him above all philosophers as much
as his exalted station raised him above other
men. We know little of Zeno, but we may
estimate his merit by that of the most dis-
tinguished of his followers. ‘⁶ What then is
it that can lead us along the right way?
One thing, and one only, Philosophy. And
this consists in keeping the daemon within
us (conscience) free from violence and harm,
superior to pains and pleasures, doing no-
thing without a purpose, nor falsely nor
hypocritically, neither caring whether an-
other does it or does not do it3 and further
in receiving what happens and what is made
our portion as coming from the place from
which we came ourselves; but above all
waiting for death with tranquil mind, as
being nothing else than the dissolution of
the elements of which every living being is
composed. And if there is no hardship
to the elements themselves in continually
changing into another, why should a man
have any apprehension about the change
and dissolution of all the elements? tor it
is according to Nature, and nothing is bad
that is according to Nature'' (Antoninus,
11. 17). The emperor understands Nature
in the sense that Bp. Butler explains it
(Sermon 3, Upon Human Nature; Antoni-
nus, xii. l ; vii. ll ; xii. 5, and many other
passages; and Aristotle, Eth. Nicom. x.
