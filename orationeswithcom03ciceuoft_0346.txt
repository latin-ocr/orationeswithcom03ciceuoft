332 ORAT. QUUM POPULO GRATIAS EGIT

vero honos, dignitas, locus, ordo, beneficia vestra, quamquam mihi
semper clarissima visa sunt, tamen ea nunc renovata illustriora
videntur quam si obscurata non essent. Ipsa autem pat-ria, dii
immortales! dici vix potest quid caritatis, quid voluptatis habeat!
quae species Italiae! quae celebritas oppidorum! quae forma re-
gionum! qui agri! quae fruges! quae pulchritudo urbis! quae
humanitas civium ! quae rei publicae dignitas ! quae vestra majes-
tas l Quibus ego omnibus antea rebus sic fruebar ut nemo magis.
Sed tamquam bona valetudo jucundior est iis qui e gravi morbo
recreati sunt quam qui numquam aegro corpore fuerunt, sic ea
omnia desiderata magis quam assidue percepta delectant.
II. Quorsum igitur haec disputo? Quorsum? Ut intelligere
possitis neminem umquam tanta eloquentia fuisse neque tam divino
atque incredibili genere dicendi, qui vestram magnitudinem
multitudinemque beneficiorum, quae in me fratremque meum et
liberos nostros contulistis non modo augere aut ornare oratione
sed enumerare aut consequi possit. A parentibus, id quod necesse
erat, parvus sum procreatus: a vobis natus sum consularis. Illi

quid voluptati-s· habent s] The MSS. have
‘habet.’ Lambinus made the correction.
The frigid bombast of this sentence will
hardly please all, though it will please

some.
tamquam bona valetudo] This is a com-

mon place and hardly wants the authority
of Plato (Republic) quoted by the Scholiast,
and by Klotz after him. Itis as frigid as
the rest; it is well said in Plato, because it
is in its proper place. A thing well said but
in the wrong place is spoiled.

2. Quorsum z'yilur haec . .
Yes, why has he said all this ?-—‘ Ut intel-
ligere possitis,' διο. He has said it only as
a flourish before introducing the ‘ divinum
atque incredibile genus dicendi.y

parvus] This is omitted by G. The
copyist found it rather too much. Who
can read it without laughing? Hotmann
supposed that ‘id quod necesse erat’ re-
ferred to ‘ parvus,’ which makes the sentence
more silly than it is. Graevius saw that
these words refer to ‘ a parentibus procre-
atus sum ς’ and he thought that ‘parvus'
should be omitted, because he could not
believe that a word so inepr in this position
at least could have come from the mouth of
Tullius. Then we have ‘ a vobis natus sum
consulariS‚' an expression which Tullius
would hardly have used. Wolf remarks
that Heiuzius, the German translator,
thought that nothing could be more beauti-

. Quorsum ,7

ful or more true than the sentiment3 and
nothing more inconsiderate, unjust, frigid,
and more pitiable than Graevius' censure.
So men differ.

Klotz observes that the Scholiast made a
correct remark on this: “ Popularis magis
quam pressa et gravis haec sententia vide-
tur3 sed facit ad aures vulgi, ut quum
parentes procreaverint hominem, ipsi pro-
vexisse et quodammodo gradibus honorum
conroborasse videantur senatoriam dignita-
tem.'' Klotz observes that we might add
that Cicero made almost the whole of this
introduction simply for the people; a very
probable conjecture. Whom should he
have made it for except those to whom it
was addressed? And we must, he says,
judge of it after this standard, if we would
not be unjust towards our orator. I sup-
pose he well knew his audience and chose
for the occasion ‘⁴ aptum [eorum] auribus
opimum quoddam et tamquam adipale
dictionis genus '' (Orator, c. 8), such as no
Greek, much less Attio ears would have
tolerated. Klotz further says ε “ the doubt-
ers would hardly have needed Gesner's
perfectly correct explanation, if they had
not approached the matter with a prejudiced
judgment.'’ This is said in answer to Mark-
land and Wolf, though he does not mention
their nameS.

We do not read Greek and Latin books,
only because they are Greek and Latin.
