500 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

meae saluti ab eodem quotidianis contionibus dicebatur. His se
tribus auctoribus in consiliis capiendis, adjutoribus in re gerenda
esse usurum dicebat3 ex quibus unum habere exercitum in Italia
maximum: duo, qui privati tum essent, et praeesse et parare si
vellent exercitum posse, idque facturos esse dicebat. Nec mihi ille
judicium populi nec legitimam aliquam contentionem nec discepta-
tionem aut caussae dictionem, sed vim, arma, exercitus, imperatoreS,
castra denuntiabat.

XVIII. Quid ergo, inimici oratio, vana praesertim, tam improbe
in clarissimos viros conjecta me movit? Me vero non illius oratio,
sed eorum taciturnitas, in quos illa oratio tam improba conferebatur ;
qui tum, quamquam ob alias caussas tacebant, tamen hominibus
omnia timentibus tacendo loqui, non infitiando confiteri videbantur.
Illi autem aliquo tum timore perterriti, quod acta illa atque omnes res
a-nni superioris labefactari a praetoribus, infirmari a senatu atque

emet-citum in Italia maximum:] Plu-
tarch (Caesar, e. 14) says of Caesar, who is
here alludcd to, that “immediately after
his marriage (with Cacsar's daughter) Pom-

rical art. Halm saw this. ‘ Disceptatio’
has a welk-settled meaning. (Vol. I. Verr.
Π. iidcvgiig] ‘ False.' He adds ‘ praeser-

peius filled the Forum with armed men and
supported the people in passing Caesar's
laws and in giving him for five years Gaul
on both sides of the Alps, with the addition
of Illyricum and four legions.” One legion
was in Gallia Provincia and three were in
winter quarters at Aquileia in North Italy
(Quum Senatui, c. 13, note). His army
was in North Italy and the Provincia, and
there was no other in Italy, as we are told
here, for Clodius would not have said that
the other two, Crassus and Pompeius,
could raise an army, if there was one already.
There was no army in Italy except Caesar's,
and his army was not at the gates of Rome.

praeesse] “ ‘praesto esse ’ F. Car. Wol-
fius ς ‘praeesse ’ Codd. ; ⁶ reipubl. praeesse '
conj. Orelli (cf. Madvig, p. 458, note);
‘rebus praeesse’ Jacob. p. 5023 ⁶ et prae-
esse ’ Schuetzius ex Ern. conj. delevit. Li-
brorum scripturam defendit Bake, p. 74⁰
(Halm). There is no satisfactory explana-
tion of ⁴ praeesse’ alone. Halm has
⁴ praesto esse ' (2).

judicium populi] A trial by the ‘po-
pulus’ assembled in ‘centuriae’ (c. 30).
Halm observes that Abrami sweated to no
purpose (he was a very hard worker) in
trying to make out the difference between
‘legitima contentio‚' ‘ disceptatio,’ and
‘ caussae dictio! He ought to have known
his author better, who would have told him,
if he had read like a man of sense, that this
abundance of words came from his rheto-

tim τ’ ⁴ the language of an enemy, and false
besides ;' a good reason why Caesar and the
others should have contradicted it; buthe
says that they did not.—‘ Illi autern τ’ he
means Caesar. The Scholiast has a good
note on the ⁴ acta illa :' ‘⁴ De actis loquitur
quae habuit in consulatu C. Caesar inauspi-
cato, ut videbatur 2 qua de re adversus eum
egerant in senatu C. Memmius et L. Domi-
tius praetores, et ipsius Caesaris orationes
contra hos exstant, quibus et sua acta de-
fendit et illos insectatur. Dat ergo causam
C. Caesari, ut videatur ea propter et Clodio
trib. et coss. Pisoni et Gabinio in perni-
ciem M. Tullii consensisse, ut ea quae in
consulatu gesserat permanerent.''

a praetoribus,] A passage in Caesar’s
Life by Suetonius, c. 23, explains this:
“Functus consulatu C. Memmio Lucioque
Domitio praetoribus de superioris anni actis
referentibus, cognitionem senatui detulit

(Caesar) : nec illo suscipiente triduoque per
irritas altercationes absumpto in provinciam
abiit: et statim quaestor ejus in praejudi-
cium aliquot criminibus arreptus est.” The
Senate had the power of indirectly repeal-
ing Leges by declaring that they had been
made irregularly; and if the Senate did this
in respect to Caesar’s Leges, his ‘ acta'
would be ⁴ infirmata.’ The ‘ principes civi-
tatis ' who were opposed to Caesar were
M. Bibulus, who had been his colleague in

the consulship, M. Cato, L. Domitius, and
others (Manutius).
