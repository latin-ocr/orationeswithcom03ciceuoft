tium, novem hominum perditissimorum poena re publiea conservata,
reliquorum mentes sanari posse arbitraretur. Atque etiam sup-
plicatio diis immortalibus pro singulari eorum merito meo nomine
decreta est, quod mihi primum post 113110 111-110111 conditam togato
contigit; et his decreta verbis est, QUOD URBEM INCENDIIS‚ CAEDE
01νΕ5, ITALIAM BELLO LHOERASSEM. Quae supplicatio si cum
ceteris conferatur, hoc interest, quod ceterae bene gesta⁷ haec
una- conservata re publica constituta est. Atque illud, quod faci-
endum primum fuit, factum atque transactum est. Nam Ρ. Len-
tulus, quamquam patefactis indiciis, confessionibus suis, judicio
senatus non modo praetoris jus, verum etiam civis amiserat, tamen
magistratu se abdicavit; ut, quae religio C. Mario clarissimo viro
non fuerat quo minus C. Glauciam, de quo nihil nominatim erat
decretum, praetorem occideret, ea nos religione in privato P. Len-
tulo puniendo liberaremur. ,

VII. Nunc quoniam, Quirites, consceleratissimi periculosissimi-
que belli nefarios duces captos jam et comprehensos tenetis, existi-
mare debetis 01111105 Catilinae copias, omnes spes atque opes, his
depulsis urbis periculis concidisse. Quem quidem ego quum ex
urbe pellebaln, hoc providebam animo, Quirites, remoto Catilina non
mihi esse P. Lentuli somnum, nec L. Cassii adipes, nec C. Cethegi

(Sallust, Cat. c. 50. 55); and we hear no
more of them. Caeparius, who had got
away, was caught and punished. See Pro
Sulla, c. l l.

quod milli primum] Caesar (B. G. ii. 35)
makes a like boast about the number of days
for which a ‘supplicatio ' was decreed for his
victories in Gallia: “ Ob easque res ex literis
Caesaris dies quindecem supplicatio decreta
est, quod ante id tempus accidit nulli.”
The ⁴ supplicatio ’ was moved by L. Aure-
lius Cotta (Phil. ii. c. 6): “L. Cotta, vir
summo ingenio summaque prudentia, rebus
iis gestis quas tu reprehendis, supplicationem
decrevit verbis amplissimis, eique illi ipsi
quos modo nominavi consulares senatusque
cunctus assensus est; qui honos post condi-
tam hanc urbem habitus est togato ante me
nemini.'’ We have the same in the Oratio
Pro Sulla, c. 3⁹3 and in 3 letter to Q. Me-
tellus Celer (Ad Fam. ν. 2) ; “ Qui curiam
caede, urbem incendii& Italiam bello 11110-
rasset.'' This, says 1131111, the 1050111111),Γ of
Italy from war, seems rhetorical amplitica-
tion. Other commentator-s have thought
that Cicero says too much. Klotz defends
him. Italy might have had a war with the
Allobroges, if thoy had been brought into
Italy by Catilina. This is plain enough.

It might have been so. But the matter is
hardly worth discussion. Cicero always
made the most of his services, His exagge-
rated style is well enough known to those
who read him.

hoc intere-§td In Halm’s school edition
and in the common editions the reading is
⁴ hoc intersit,' a reading which would make
3 careful student pause to consider whether
the text was right. ¹ Hoc intersit ’ is Latin,
that is, the subjunctive may stand in this
0131150111 correspondence with the subjunc-
tive in the first clause; but it would not
express what is meant. Cicero says, “if
you were to compare this ‘supplicatio' with
all others, the difference between them is
this.''

C. Glauciam] Glaucia had not abdicated
his praetorship. He was killed with the
insignia of his offis-e on him, and a quaestor
and a tribune at the same time; all with
the insignia of their office 011 them (Vol. ΙΙ.
p. 472). They had been (1001111011 rebels,
an 31111011 force had compelled 1111111 to sur-
render; but they were shut up 111 the Curia
Hostilia after receivingtlie ⁴ 111105 ,1111111033 as
some say, and as Cicero hardly ventures to
deny. 'Here he perverts the facts.
