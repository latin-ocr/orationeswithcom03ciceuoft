Clodius’ sister and the consul Metellus’
wife (Ad Att. ii. l): “Non consulare, 111-
quies, dictum: fateor.”

patrem tumn . . . vestri] Appius Clau-
dius was praetor B.c. 89 (Pro Archia, c. 5).
WVhen he says ‘vestri‚⁷ he includes P. Clo-
dius' brother, Appius Clodius. Appius the
father was deprived of his ‘imperium’ -in
the troublesome times of Cinna, as it is said
here. Drumann (Geschichte Roms, ii. p.
184) makes him the consul of B.c. 79. See
De Harusp. cc. l, 12.

32. in senatu juratus] What occasion
had Cotta for saying this on oath (juratus) ?
L. Cotta was censor B.c. 63. There was
no ‘lustrum’ during Cicero’s exile. Cotta
is said to have said that if he had been
censor when Cicero was absent, he would
have read his name in the list of senators,
would have acknowledged him to be a sena-
tor still. That would have been regular:
he might have done it, if he chose. ⁸ Reci-
tare ’ is the proper word. But in c. 31 he

being chosen as a member of the senate
(Livy, 23. c. ⁴23). He had said a little be-
fore that Clodius could not deny that he
was a senator, though he was not at Rome.

Quis in meum locum] Manutius says
that the first ‘ decuria ' of the judices at the
beginning of the year was taken from the
‘ordo senatorius‚' according to the Aurelia
Lex. It would have been much more to
the purpose if he had asked, Who was put
in my place? But ⁶ subdidit ' is the wrong
word (Vol. I. Verr. Act. l. c. 10).--ι Dis-
cessu meoz’ he means in his absence, but
the words mean ‘ when I went away.' Com-
pare Pro Sestio, c. 60: “omnia discessu
meo.'' It was usual for a Roman to make
some mention of his nearest friends in his tes-
tament, which was a mark of respect. Klotz
defends the expression ‘discessu nieo' by
comparing the passage in the Dc Legibus
(ii. l7): “Omnia tum perditorum civium
scelere discessu meo religionum jura pol-
luta sunt : vexati nostri lares-familiares: in
