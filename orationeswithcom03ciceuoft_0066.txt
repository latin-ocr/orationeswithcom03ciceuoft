ORATIO TERTIA,

AD QUIRITES.

I. REM publicam, Quirites, vitamque omnium vestrum, bona, for-

tunas, conjuges liberosque vestros,

atque hoc domicilium clarissimi

imperii, fortunatissimam pulcherrimamque urbem hodierno die
deorum immortalium summo erga vos amore, laboribus, consiliis,
periculis meis e flamma atque ferro ac paene ex faucibus fati

ereptam et vobis conservatam ac

restitutam videtis. Et, si non

minus nobis jucundi atque illustres sunt ¹ii dies quibus conservamur
quani illi quibus nascimur, quod salutis certa laetitia est, nascendi
incerta conditio, et quod sine sensu nascimur, cum voluptate serva-
mur, profecto, quoniam illum, qui hanc urbem condidit, ad deos

l. nascendi ineerta conditio] “Uncer-
tain is the condition which our birth deter-
mines.'' We are born, but we know not
what we are born to. The Trausi (Herod.
v. 4), a Thracian nation, do this when a
child is born or a person dies. “When a
child is born, the relations sit round it and
lament for the evils that the child must
endnre now that he is born, enumerating
all the pains that man is subject to. But
when a person dies, they make merry, and
with joy put him in the earth, telling the
sorrows from which he is released and how
he is now in tlw enjoyment of all happi-
ness.'’ The Mor-avians wear no inonrning
for the (lead, sor they look on death as a
release from earthly bonds: they say that
the dead is gone home to the L‹›r‹l. The
usage of modern nations called vivilized
differs from the Thracian usage. Which is
right, the ‹eivilized inan, as lic is called, or
the barbarian, as we call him ?

qui hanc urbem] The founder of Rome,

Romulus, was honoured as a god, and he
had a festival, the Quirinalia, on the seven-
teenth of February.

‘⁶ Proxima lux vacua est: at tertia dicta
Quirino.

Qui tenet hoc nomen Romulus ante
fuit.” (Ovid, Fasti ii. 475.)

About seven centuries had passed from the
supposed age of Romulus to that of Cicero;
and the name of Rome's founder had never
been forgotten. His birth was supernatural;
but he lived on earth like other wal-like
kings, and founders of dynasties His end
was supernatural too5 sor lie was taken up
to heaven.

‘⁶ hac Quirinus
Martis equis Acheronta tngit.’‘

(Hor. Carm. iii. 3.)
Or as Ovid (Fasti ii. 4316) tells it ε
“ Rex patriis astra petebat equis.'’
