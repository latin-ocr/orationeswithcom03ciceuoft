518 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

cripta? quod genus imperii aut quae provincia, quae ratio aut
flandae aut conflandae pecuniae non reperiebatur? quae regio
orave terrarum erat latior, in qua non regnum aliquod statueretur?
quis autem rex erat, qui illo anno non aut emendum sibi quod non
habebat, aut redimendum quod habebat, arbitraretur? quis provin-
ciam, quis pecuniam, quis legationem a senatu petebat? Damnatis
de vi restitutio, consulatus petitio ipsi illi populari sacerdoti com-
parabatur. Haec gemebant boni, sperabant improbi, agebat tri-
bunus plebis, consules adjuvabant.

XXXI. Hic aliquando, serius quam ipse vellet, Cn. Pompeius,
invitissimis iis, qui mentem optimi ac fortissimi viri suis consiliis
fictisque terroribus a defensione meae salutis averterant, excitavit
illam suam non sopitam, sed suspicione aliqua retardatam con-
suetudinem rei publicae bene gerendae. Non est passus ille vir,

‘ discripta! We have thus in one instance
secured the genuine word.
quae provincia,] P. has ⁴ provintia.’ We

sayS, is to ‘ melt metal,’ and ‘flare pecu-
niam‚' to make coin by melting metal ε and
on the other hand ⁴ conflare metalla ¹ means

have now got many examples of this form.
Halm thinks it necessary to tell us that
‘provincia' in this passage means func-
tion, occupatum, or public einploynient,
and that none of the commentators appear
to have seen this; which is singular, if it
is true, for the context makes it quite plain.

ratio aut flandae aut conflandae] P. G.
The old editions have ‘ ratio auferendae aut
conflandae) Halm observes that Klotz is
the only recent editor who has taken the
reading which is in the text: which he
translates “welche Art und VVeise Geld zu
schlagen und zusammenzuschlagen ward
nicht ausfindig gemacht ? ” Lambinus ob-
jected to ‘aut flandae‚’ that Cicero is not
speaking ‘⁴ de ratione pecuniae flandae, seu
potius auri argentive flandi, sed de ratione
pecuniae conciliandae et conquirendae et
undique corradendae.'' Two passages are
cited to show that ‘ flandae pecuniae ’ may
be right (Ulp. Dig. 48. 10. 9) ε “argenteos
nummos adulterinos flaverit‚'' and Varro in
Gellius ii. 10: “ flata signataque pecu-
nia;'’ in which passage he also informs us
that what the Romans named ‘thesauri,’
taking a Greek word, the Prisci Latini
named ‘⁴ flavissae, quod in eos non rude aes
argentumque, sed flata signataque pecunia
conderetur.'’ Halm however raises a diffi-
culty about the translation, for, as he ob-
serves, since ‘flare’ and ‘ conflare’ are
terms applied to melted metals, it seems in-
consistent for one word to be used by the
orator in its literal sense and the other in
its metaphorical. ‘Flare metallum,' he

either to melt various metals into one mass,
or to melt metal which has already a shape,
and to change it to another form (Metall
einschmelzen): thus, he adds, the Romans
said ‘ vasa, statuae‚' and such things ⁴ con-
flantur.' After this preparation Halm adds
that a more difficult question arises, in what
sense these two words are used metaphori-
cally, for it seems plain to him that both
are used metaphorically. But this is enough.
After this we either know the meaning or
we do not; and no more need be said.

redimendum] The context explains it:
he must pay for being allowed to keep what
he had.

Damnatis de vz' restituti0,] ⁴ in integrum.'
Garatoni supposes that the partizans of Ca-
tilina are meant, who are mentioned in the
oration Pro Sulla, c. 2, who being convicted
(B.c. 62) under the Lex Plautia de vi left
the country. Even in B.c.59 there was talk
about restoring these men (Pro Flacco, c.
38) (Halm).

31. aliquando‚] Halm prefers this to the
reading ‘aliquanto,' and he thinks that it
is recommended by the passage in the De
Domo (e. 10), which, he says, is copied from
this: ‘⁶ Sed excitatus aliquando.”

ille vim] He runs out, as usual, into ex-
travagant praise of Pompeius, whose great
deeds are commemorated in the oration De
Imp. Cn. Pompeii, c. 10, ll, and the notes,
&c.—‘ etiam servitia :’ Pompeius returning
from Spain fell in with the slaves whom
Crassus had dispersed and cut them to
pieces. Manutius explains ‘etiam' thus:
