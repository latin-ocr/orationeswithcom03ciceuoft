468 ORAT. DE HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS

tiorum Brogitarorumque praedas exsorbuit? aut tam eminentibus
canibus Scyllam tamque jejunis quam quibus istum videtis Gelliis,
Clodiis, Titiis, Rostra ipsa mandentem?

Quare, id quod extremum est in haruspicum responso, pro-
videte NE nni PUBLICAE STATUS COMMUTETUR. Etenim vix
haec, si undique fulciamus, jam labefacta, vix, inquam, nixa in
omnium nostrum humeris cohaerebunt. XXVIII. Fuit quondam
ita firma haec civitas et valens, ut negligentiam senatus vel etiam
injurias civium serre posset. Jam non potest. Aerarium nullum
est: vectigalibus non fruuntur qui redemerunt: auctoritas prin-
cipum cecidit.: consensus ordinum est divulsus: judicia perierunt:
suffragia discripta tenentur a paucis: bonorum animus ad nutum

to write ‘imminentibus,' because he sup-
poses that this is taken from the Verr. ii.
2. c. 54: “Nam ipsum Verrem tantum
avaritia semper hiante atque imminenti
fuisse.’' The other part of the sentence,
he supposes, may be an imitation of the
Verr. ii. 3. c. ll : ‘⁴ Horum canum quos tri-
bunal meum vides lambere ;’' and Graevius
would have changed ‘mandentem ’ in this
passage into ⁴ lainbeutem,’ manifestly to the
injury of the sense3 for as Gesner says, after
remarking on the propriety of the expres-
sion ‘ canes eminentes :’ ‘⁴ similis pictura et
vehementia est in canibus Clodii, h. e. ra—
bulis, roslra ipsa mandentibus, quarn ad-
mirari satius quam reprehendere.'' Ernesti
has a wonderful exposition of the passage.
⁴ Rostra’ are ships. Scylla's dogs only eat
men; Clodius’ dogs were so hungry that
they swallowed even the ships, that is, the
Res Publica itself, by means of the Leges
which Clodius proposed on the Rostra.

quantas iste . . . exsorbuit .?] ⁴‘ It is
almost ludicrous when Wolf, in order to
prove that this speech is not genuine, re-
marks here that no person who was not
informed in some other way, could have
known what the orator here alludes to.
For that is precisely a complete proof that
the orator had before him persons who
were informed of the crimes of P. Clodius
or of the crimes imputed to him, that is,
that consequently the genuine Cicero spoke
in the genuine Senate. Resides, it was not
Cicero’s purpose to say whether Ρ. Clodius
had got all which had been promised to
him in writing; aud so he might quite
correctly say ‘praedas exsorbuit,' if Bro-
gitarus was a slow payer, or even if Clodius
had still money to receive in Byzantium '’
(Klotz).

The note to which Klotz refers is not

Wolf’s, but Garatoni’s, whose words Wolf
has copied3 and he says: “Haec omnia
Garatonii verba adscripsi, quia sunt ejus-
modi, ut vix aliter scribere potuisset vir
optimus, si nostram sententiam de auctori-
tate orationis amplexus esset.”

Wolf uses Garatoni’s words, which how-
ever, as he says, express what he would
have said. The objection is not exactly
made as Klotz states it. The objectionis
this t If we did not know by other means
what the matter was, we might suppose
that Clodius had plundered Byzantium, and
we should have expected the name of an-
other people, who shared the misfortunes of
the Byzantini. The story about the Byzan-
tini is told in the Pro Sestio, c. 26, and of
Brogitarus and the temple of Pessinus.
Brogitarus is mentioned in this oration,
c. 13. The matter is not worth a further
thought. Klotz assumes that it is evidence
of this speech being by Cicero and having
been delivered in the Senate, that the writer
says what the Senate would understand,
though we might not. It is no evidence
either one way or the other.

ne rei publicae] “ Cicero knew how to
handle dexterously this warning also, which
manifestly referred to the bad design which
the Triumviri harboured against the state,
and with all his intimations about the real
state of things, he still came forward not
altogether without precaution ” (Klotz). The
Triumviri, falsely so called, were Pompeius,
Crassus, and Caesar.

28. Aerarium. . . vectiqalihus] Klotz
refers to In Pison, c. 34, 40, and De Prov.
Cons. c. 5. The Declamator falls into ex-
travagant assertions here, in his usual way.

discripta] ‘discripta in rasura P².;
districta M! Here we have evidence ofa
genuine form, which evidence is hard to get,
