ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 11

of the city was more than men wished for, who would be the chief losers
by it ; men who had nothing but their clothes and the produce of their
daily toil. (Sallust, Cat. c. 48.)

The freedmen and some of the clients of Lentulus and Cethegus tried
to stir up the artisans and slaves to liberate the prisoners. But Cicero
provided against this danger3 and on the fifth of December he sum-
moned the Senate to the temple of Concordia to deliberate on the
punishment of the conspirators The slope of the Capitolinus on which
the temple stood was covered with Roman Equites under arms. The
Senate had already declared that the conspirators were enemies to the
State. The question now was, What the Senate would do with those
who were in custody. D. J unius Silanus, who as consul designatus was
first asked his opinion, moved that those who were in custody, and four
others if they should be caught, should be punished (supplicium sumen-
dum). The Consulares who spoke after him were of the same mind
(Cic. ad Att. xii. 21). C. Julius Caesar, now Praetor designatus, gave
a different turn to the matter. Sallust (Cat. c. 50) has reported his
speech, but he does not say that he has kept the exact words If he
has altered them, it was a very useless piece of labour, for Caesar's own
words would have told us his meaning as well as Sallust could. There
seems however no reason to doubt that Sallust has given us Caesar’s
argument. The speech is the work of a master hand, and an evidence
of the great ability of the aspiring young Roman. Caesar said that
the infliction of capital punishment would be illegal3 which nobody
could deny, for the men had not been tried. He said it would be a
dangerous precedent, and he proposed instead of the capital punishment
to confiscate the property of the conspirators, to distribute them among
the most powerful Municipia to be kept in prison for life, and to make
the Municipia responsible for them under severe penalties. It was
obvious enough, that, if these men vvere imprisoned, they might some
day have the chance of escaping3 and Caesar met this objection by
proposing that no man should ever make any motion in the Senate or
propose to the people any thing about these men; and that any man
who should act otherwise, should be considered an enemy.

Caesar's reasons for his proposal are given in his own speech. But
his true reasons are guessed by others. Plutarch (Cicero, c. 20) says:
“ Caesar, who was then a young man and in the very beginning of his
rise to power, and already in his policy and his hopes had entered on
that road by which he changed the state of Rome into a monarchy,
though he eluded the penetration of the rest, caused great suspicion to
Cicero, without however giving him any hold for complete pr00f3 but
there were some heard to say that he came near being caught and yet
had escaped from Cicero.'' A modern writer (Drumann, Geschichte
