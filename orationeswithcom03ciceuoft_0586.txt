572 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

LXVIII. Homines Graeci, quos antea nominavi, inique a suis
civibus damnati atque expulsi, tamen, quia bene sunt de suis eivi-
tatibus meriti, tanta hodie gloria sunt non in Graecia solum, sed
etiam apud nos atque in ceteris terris, ut eos a quibus illi oppressi
sunt nemo nominet, horum calamitatem dominationi illorum omnes
anteponant. Quis Karthaginiensium pluris fuit Hannibale consilio,
virtute, rebus gestis, qui unus cum tot imperatoribus nostris per tot
annos de imperio et de gloria decertavit? Hunc sui cives e civi-
tate ejeccrunt: nos etiam hostem litteris nostris et memoria vide-
mus esse celebratum. Quare imitemur nostros Brutos, Camillos,
Ahalas, Decios, Curios, Fabricios, Maximos, Scipiones, Lentulos,
Aemilios, innumerabiles alios, qui hanc rem publicam stabiliverunt;
quos equidem in deorum immortalium coetu ac numero repone.
Amemus patriam, pareamus senatui, consulamus bonis: praesentes
fructus negligamus, posteritatis gloriae serviamus: id esse opti-

of which is great and noble, and choose for
the other term ot* the comparison something
small, ignoblc, and bad; it is little that we
say for the great and noble, if we can say
no more than that it is better than a bad
thing. According to the emendation, Cicero
might as well have said, good is better than
bad. If he said to “dio in defence of the
Patria ” is really nothing ditl'erent from
“ gaining the supreme power by an attaek
on the Patria,'’ he may mean that supreme
power. the great object of men’s ambition,
that which L. Sulla for instance had got,
ought to be valued by no man more than to
die in defence of so glorious a common-
wealth. Death in defence of so noble a
thing is as good as to get the mastery of it
aud live; and to usurp supreme power and
hold it successfully is, according to common
opinion, as we now all know by example, a
very glorious thing.

Halm, atter saying of Klotz what I have
quoted, adds: “Ac videas, quaeso, quam
sibi constet orator patriae non amantissi-
mus; nam paulo post (e. 68): ‘ut 605,γ
inquit, ‘ a quibus,' '' &c. His perception is
not very quick, or he would see that this is
against him. In this next chapter Cicero
says that the honest Greeks, who were con-
demned and expelled by their know-citizens,
have such a good character, that nobody
utters the names of their oppressum, and
every body sets the unlucky lot of the suf-
ferers higher than the domination of those
who were powerful enough to oppress them.
—But the ‘dominatio ’ of the victorious
party was something. It was power and
superiority: it was a thing which all men

value. If we were sure that ⁴ non aliud ' is
not right, it would be absurd to attempt to
explain it. But if there is no evidence in
the reading sor supposing it to be false,
we should 566 if it is capable of any inter-
pretation before we alter it.

68. IIunc . . . estem-unffi] ‘Non ejectus
est ' (Manutius), who quotes Nepos, Life of
lIannibal, to show that [Iannibal left home for
sear of being given up to the Romans. That
was ejection enough.—‘ hostem celebratum ι’
They spoke of him as perfidious and cruel.
They had not much good to say of him.
There is a curious passage in Pliny (34. c.
(5), quoted by Abrami: ‘⁴ adeo discrimen
omne sublatum, ut Hannibalis etiam statuae
tribus locis visantur in urhe, cujus intra
muros solus hostium emisit hastam.'’

Brutos,] The usual listof Roman worthies.
Cicero mentions the Lentuli to please Lentu-
lus, by whose exertions he had been recalled,
and the Aemilii to please Scaurus, who pre-
sided at this trial (Abram.). As to the plu-
rals, see Hor. Sat. i. 7. 8, Macleane’s note.

posteritatis qloriae] “ Quae a posteritate
in nos redundat, quaque apud posteros frui-
mur,'’ Matthiae, who refers to Pro C. Ra-
birio, c. 10: “neque quisquam nostrum . . .
quin spe posteritatis fructuque ducatur.'’
(Vol. ΙΙ,, and the note.) Cicero is always a
little obscure when he talks of glory and
posterity. Here he says, “ let us neglect
present profit, let us make ourselves slaves
to the glory of posterity.'' I do not ex-
amine into his meaning very exactly, for all
such phrases will not bear close examina-
ti0n; but we may take 1115 words to mean
this in a general way: “let us secure a
