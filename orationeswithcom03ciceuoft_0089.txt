in the classical writers. Cicero assumes
that Silanus calls to his recollection the
fact that Roman citizens have before been
summarily punished with death.

Alter inlelligit] C. Caesar was ⁴ praetor
designatus,’ or, as Cicero has it (Ad Art. xii.
21) ⁴ quitum praetorio loco dixerit.' In this
letter to Atticus Cicero tinds fault with a
letter of Brutus, who was entirely mistaken
about the proceedings in the Senate on this
day, for he said: “Catonem primum sen-
tentiam putat de animadversione dixisse,
quam omnes ante dixerant praeter Cae-
sarem.” The speech of Caesar isin Sal-
lust (Cat. c. 51), who says, “hujuscemodi
verba locutus est.” He does not profess to
give the very words. Caesar’s opinion was
this: No punishment was too severe for
the conspirators’ crimes ; but he adds with
great sagacity; “ most people thjnk of what
comes last, and in the case of bad men they
forget the crime and speak of the punish-
ment, if it has been rather severe.’' Caesar
objects to the proposal of Silanus that there
was no precedent. As to the punishment
of death he makes this remark, which Cicero
has reported in words different from Sal-
lust’s, but the same in substance: “De
poena possumus equidem dicere id quod res
habet: in luctu atque miseriis mortem
aerumnarum requiem, non cruciatum esse3
eam cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere;
ultra neque curae neque gaudio locum
esse.” Caesar’s remark touches the ques-
tion of the punishment of death nearer than
the vague talk of many persons who dis-
cussit now. In the nature of things, ac-
cording to Nature, death is not a punish-
ment. Death is no more a punishment
than birth. It may however be said that
premature death is a punishment: that a
man who shortens his life by intemperancc
is punished for his intemperance. But it is
also true that a man may shorten his life
by labour in a good thing, by fighting for
the Patria, and in many other ways which
are not dishmourable, base, or bad. Pre-
mature death then is not a punishment.
It is also true that according to Nature,
according to the order of thingS, the in-
temperate man or the bad man, who lives
and suffers in consequence of his intem·
perance and badness, is punished. The
punishment of a criminal then is natural,
it is in the order of nature, so long as he is
allowed to live and is made to suffer. The
punishment called the punishment of death
is unnatural ε it is not a punishment which

Itaque eam

imitates the order of nature, for death ends
all suffering, and this event which must
happen some time is only anticipated by
the law or by the will of one who has the
power to anticipate it. How can that bc
called a punishment, which begins and ends
in the same moment? Unless we reckon
the sear of death in the interval between
condemnation and execution a part of the
punishment. But death ends that too.
The two reasons for the punishment of
death are these. It removes the guilty per-
son out of the world, and he can do no
more harm. Those who argue against the
punishment of death do not judge rightly of
this matter3 and yet it is the best reason for
the punishment of death, if we assume that
the criminal code only inflicts this punish--
ment on men who have shown that they are
dangerous to society. Such men must be
removed, they must be put out of the way,
either by death or by eternal imprisonment.
There is no other way of dealing with crimi-
nals whose crimes have become a habit.
The other reason for the punishment of
death, and for all punishment is, that it
deters from crime or from the act that is
forbidden under a penalty. It is certain
that all punishment deters to some extent:
and the punishment os death among other
punishments. But the efficacy of the punish-
ment called death depends greatly on the
opinion of another life. He who believes
that death will be the beginning of a severer
punishment than he can suffer in this life
has good reason for fearing it. But in
Cicero’s time, as he tells us here, aud
plainer in another place (Pro Cluentio,
c. 61), the notion of a state of punishment
after death was laughed at: it was an old
woman’s story. Even the sear of punish-
ment after death is not a fear strong enough
to deter altogether from crime. It' there is
a belief in another life, the fear of punish-
ment after death has some effect. If there
is no belief, of course there is no sear of
what may come after death; and all that
remains is the fcar of death itselt'. How
small that sear is in men who are bold
enough to commit great crimes, is a fact
that is well known. Death is always before
our eyes. It may come any day. It is
only the unccrtainty of the time that makes
the difl'erence between death which comes
by disease or accident, and death which
comes by the will of another. The punish-
ment of death consists in the apprehension
of it, and in the certainty of the time when
