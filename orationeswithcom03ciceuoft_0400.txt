386 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

tacito jam erumpebat nacta tam audaces duces, excepi meo cor-
pore. In me uno consulares faces jactae manibus tribuniciis, in
me onmia quae ego quondam rettuderam conjurationis nefaria tela
adhaeserunt. Quod 51, 111 multis fortissimis viris placuit, vi et
armis contra vim decertare voluissem, aut vicissem cum magna
internecione improborum, sed tamen civium, aut interfectis bonis
omnibus, quod illis optatissimum fuisset, una cum re publica con-
cidissem. Videbam vivo senatu populoque Romano celerem mihi
summa cum dignitate reditum3 nec intelligebam fieri diutius posse
ut mihi non liceret esse in ea re publica quam ipse servassem.
Quod si non liceret, audieram et legeram clarissimos nostrae
civitatis viros se in medios hostes ad perspicuam mortem pro salute
exercitus injecisse; ego pro salute universae rei publicae dubitarem
hoc meliore conditione esse quam Decii, quod illi ne auditores
quidem suae gloriae, ego etiam spectator meae laudis esse potuis-
sem? XXV. ltaque infractus furor tuus inanes faciebat impetus 3
omnem enim vim omnium sceleratorum acerbitas mei casus
exceperat: non erat in tam immani injuria tantisque ruinis novae
crudelitati locus. Cato fuerat proximus. Quid ageres non erat,

Videbam . . . redilum ,] This does not
appear to be Latin. A word may have
dropped out. Cicero himself did not ex-
pect to return so soon. (Quum Populo,
c. 6.)

clarissimos . . . viros] The Decii are
mentioned 111 1116 01311011 Pro P. Sestio, c.
‘He—In Wolf's edition and in others, part
of this sentence stands thus: ‘⁴ injecisse:
ego . . . dubitarem ? hoc meliore conditione
quam Decii,'' &c. The addition of the
word ‘ esse’ shows that the pointing should
be different, but though we thus remove
one of Wolf’s objections, we make non-
sense, and that 15 501116 evidence that we
have got the genuine text. “I 11311 heard
and read (he had even read) of most illus-
trious men sacrifieing their lives for their
army; should Ι for 1116 safety of the state
hesitate to be (for that 15 the meaning3 it
does not mean, should I doubt if I was) so
far in a better condition than the Decii,
inasmuch as they could not (have been ?)
hearers of their own fame, I might have
been even a spectator of mine?’¹ Here
again we see the trifler. He wishes to
make a parallel between himself and the
Decii; and accordingly they must devote
themselves for the safety of the army, their

state, in order that 116 may do what for 1116
safety of the state? devote himself? no;
that he may be in 3 much better condition
than they were, who could not hear their
own praises, while he might have been even
a spectator of his glory.—Such a trivial,
tasteless compar-ison 15 1116 work of a man
without [iudei-standing. Wolf suggests that
he might have been a spectator of it ‘⁴ in
scena, 111 tragoedia, agente fortasse aliquo
Aesopo.''

25. infractus . . . tuus] He begins (Hanc
ego vim, pontifices) by addressing the Pon-
tifices, and he ends with being the spectator
of his own glory (spectator meae laudis).
With an ‘itaque’ (Itaque infractus furor
tuus) he turns 10 Clodius. He is arguing
for 1115 1101156 before the Pontifices, and
continually addressing Clodius. There is
110 difficulty 111 seeing how the writer has
been led to do this. He knew that Cicero
often did abuse Clodius, and he knew that
he had maintained his claim for his house
before the Pontifices; and he may have
read the speech· if Cicero published it. He
put the abuse and 1116 argument together,
and made Cicero utter a Philippic against
Clodius and address a legal argument to
the Pontifices at the same time.
