OAP. 6-8, 25

odium omnium justum et jam diu tibi debitum, dubitas, quorum
mentes sensusque vulneras, eorum aspectum praesentiamque vitare?

Si te parentes timerent atque odissent tui, neque eos ulla ratione „
nris-0⁷ ’Νι

placare posses, ut opinor, ab eorum oculis aliquo concederes: nunc
te patria, quae communis est parens omniurn nostrum, odit ac
metuit, et jamdiu te nihil judicat nisi de parricidio suo cogitare;
hujus tu neque auctoritatem verebere, neque judicium sequere,
neque vim pertimesces? Quae tecum, Catilina, sic agit, et quo—
dammodo tacita loquitur: Nullum jam aliquot annis facinus exstitit
nisi per te, nullum flagitium sine te: tibi uni multorum civium
neces, tibi vexatio direptioque sociorum impunita fuit ac libera: tu
non solum ad negligendas leges ac quaestioneS, verum etiam ad
evertendas perfringendasque valuisti. Superiora illa, quamquam
ferenda non fuerunt, tamen ut potui tuli : nunc vero me totam esse
in metu propter te unum, quidquid increpuerit Catilinam timeri,
nullum VJIQssontra me consilium iniri posse quod a tuo scelere
abhorreat, non est ferendum. Quamobrem discede atque hunc
miffi timorem eripe, si est verus, ne opprimam sin falsus, ut tan-
dem aliquando timere desinam. VIII. Haec si tecum, ut dixi,
patria loquatur, nonne impetrare debeat, etiamsi vim adhibere
non possit? Quid, quod tu te ipse in custodiam dedisti? quid,
quod vitandae suspicionis caussa ad M. Lepidum te habitare velle

Quae tecum—tacita] The Patria (la
Patrie) does not speak, but she speaks in
a manner, though she is silent. This, says
Muretus, is a most beautiful example of
Prosopopoea; and he supposes that Cicero
imitated the passage in the Crito of Plato
(e. 12), where the Law (oi νόμοι) expostu-
lates with Socrates z Τι’ οὖν, ἂν εἴπωσιν οἱ
νόμοι, Ὦ Σώκρατες, ἦ καὶ ταῦτα ὡμολό-
γητο ἡμῖν τε καὶ σοι’, ἦ ἐμμένειν ταῖς δι’·
καις αἷς ἂν ἡ πόλις δικάζῃ; Socrates
admits that there was a compact between
himself and the LaW‚ and on the admission
of a falsehood the argument proceeds. He
admits the Law to be the author of his ex-
istence; that with the aid of the Law his
father took his mother and begat him. He
was the son of the Law consequently‚ and
owed to it the. obedience of a son. The
form of the Dialogue is lively and pleasing3
the matter is absurd. Cicero's expostula-
tion of the Patria is in a different tone, as
it is for a different purpose.

⁷zece‹s·,—veoealio] He was charged with hav-
ing murdered people in the time of Sulla,
and with having plundered the Provinciales
when he was governor of Africa (Introd.).

—‘ quaestiones! See Vol. I. Index.
quidquid increpuerit] ‘⁶ Whenever there
is a noise, that Catilina should be feared.''
So in the oration Pro Murena, c. 10, he
sayS, “simul atque increpuit suspicio tu-
multus.'’ Halm has ¹ propter unum te.'

8. in custodiam] Sallust (Cat. 47) has
the expression ‘in liberis custodiis habe-
rentur‚' which is explained by what fol-
lows. The men were put in the hands of
the several persons who were appointed to
keep them in custody. This was done when
the crime was not proved or confessed.
They were intrusted to the keeping of pri-
vate persons instead of being put in prison.
Catilina offered to surrender himself after
the commencement of a prosecution De vi
Publica by L. Paullus. (Introd.)

ad M. Lepidum] One of the consuls of
13.c.66. Halm says that many gramma-
rians quote this passage as an instance ot'
Cicero using ⁴ ad' for ‘ apud.‘ Servius (Ad
Aen. i. 28) is one of these graniniarians.
In his commentary on the line

“ Prima quod ad Trojam pro caris gesserat
Argis‚”
