of ‘ stare ’ have an active sense, and perhaps
the verb ‘stare' had in some cases. In
Greek the active and the passive notionis
altogether confounded in the same verb
(ἳ-στη-μι). ¹ Praestare ’ in its active sense
means to ‘place before,' that is to do a
thing, to make an order or a resolution of
the wiu a reality in act. Halm has a note
on this, which is worth reading as an answer
to a proposed emendation of a learned
critic, who however is sometimes too acute
to see a plain thing. “Praestare possit,
that is, ‘to answer for.’ Since such aprae-
stare is a matter of the will and the resolu-
tion, not of the power, Madvig (Opusc.
Acad. p. 151) with Heumann would strike
out possit, and make the infinitive depend
on non dubitet, a conjecture, which on ac-

parere or after praestare, has little proba-
bility to recommend it. The correctness of
the reading possit is supported particularly
by the addition of the words ⁴ per se ipsum,’
by which Cicero expresses, though certainly
with too much sels-confidence, that he feels
himself strong enough to maintain alone
the decrees of the Senate against any at-
tack.'’ The proposed alteration is a sample
of great want of judgment and great pre-
sumption. All the MSS. have ‘ possit,’
which is enough, if it is intelligible. But
it is more than intelligible. The sentence
requires it; if it had been omitted, some
judgment would have been shown in pro-
posing to add it. Cicero says, and he
ought to say: “You have a consul ready
to obey your orders, and able as long as he
shall live to maintain your resolutions and
himself to give them effect.''

Nota—When I wrote the notes on these four orations, Ι had Halm's edition of 1851
(Cicero’s Ausgewaehlte Redeu, Vol. iii.)‚ which I supposed to be the latest. But there is
an edition ot 1853. 1 have compared this edition only with the last five chapters of the
Fourth oration, but I have made no alterations in my notes. Halm says of his second
edition of this volume (iii.)‚ which contains the orations In Catilinam, Pro P. Sulla and
Pro Archia, that he has made very numerous corrections and additions in the commentary‚
and some alterations in the critical notes. I have used for the text, as I have already said
in the Preface, his edition of 1854 (Orelh's second edition).
