CICERONIS

PRO

L. MURENA

ORATIO.

J.. QUAE precatus a diis immortalibus sum, judices, more instituto-
que majorum, illo die quo auspicato comitiis centuriatis L. Murenam
consulem renuntiavi, ut ea res mihi magistratuique meo, populo
plebique Romanae bene atque feliciter eveniret; eadem precor ab
iisdem diis immortalibus ob ejusdem hominis consulatum una cum
salute obtinendum, et ut vestrae mentes atque sententiae cum
populi Romani voluntatibus suffragiisque consentiant, eaque res
vobis populoque Romano pacem, tranquillitatem, otium concordiam-

que afferat.

l. Quaeprecatns] The MSS.have‘ Quae
deprecatu& but Quintilian, who quotes this
passage (Inst. ix. 4, 107) as an example
of a discourse beginning with a cretic, has
‘ Quod precatus a diis immortalibus sum,’
and Donatus (ad Terent. Andr. iii. 4, 3)
has ‘Quod precatus sum a diis immortali-
bus.' It is however possible that both of
them had in view the passage of the ora-
tion Pro Red. ad Quin, which begins “Quod
precatus a Jove—ceterisque diis immortali-
bus” (Halm). If ‘deprecari' is right, it
may be considered as a stronger form of
‘ precari.'

remmtiari‚] The technical word by which
is expressed that the consul who presided
at the election declares thc candidate duly
elected—‘mihi magistratuique meo :⁷ ‘mihi,
fidei magistratuique meo,' Halm.—‘ ob...
obtinendum? ‘that Murena may be ac-
quitted and retain the. consulship! His
⁴ salus ' is his acquittal. ‘ anue res ’ refers
to what has gone before, to ¹ ut vestrae
consentiant) Moebius says that ‘ea res'
means ‘ ea renuntiatio ;⁷ but it is not so.

illa sollemnis-precatio] The ‘magistra-
tus’ who addressed the people began with a

Quod si illa sollemnis comitiorum precatio consulari-

prayer: ‘⁴ Consules in rostra escenderunt,
et contione advocata, quum solemne car-
men precationis quod praefari priusquam
populum alloquantur magistratus solent,
peregisset consul ita coepit ’' (Liv. 39, c. 15).
—‘ Me rogante ε’ when he held the Comitia,
and asked the people whom they would
have for consuls, for ‘ rogare ' is said of the
presiding magistrate at electioris as well as
of him who proposes a Lex. It is not easy
to see the connexion between ‘Quod si¹
and ‘idem ego.5 I do not find any notice
of this by the critics. The translation is:
‘⁴ Now if that solemn prayer made at the
comitia, consecrated by the consular auspi-
cia, contains in it all the efficacy and all the
religious observance that the honour of the
state requires, I also prayed that to the men,
on whom this consulship was eonferred when
I held the comitia, it might be a lucky, a
fortunate, and a happy event.” The diffi-
culty is in seeing why he says ⁴ if that
solemn prayer ’ διο. ; but I suppose he
means to say that if the prayer was all that
it ought to be, it contained by implication
at least a prayer for the prosperity of the
two new consuls.
