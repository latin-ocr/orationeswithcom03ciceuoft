publici, aut ambitionis aut commendationis gratia : sed recito me-
moriam perfuncti periculi, praedicationem amplissimi beneficii,
vocem officii praesentis, testimonium praeteriti temporis. Atque
illis temporibus isdem, quum jam Capuam metu Sestius liberasset,
urbem senatus atque omnes boni deprehensis atque oppressis domes-
ticis hostibus me duce ex periculis maximis extraxissent, ego
litteris P. Sestium Capua arcessivi cum illo exercitu quem tum
secum habebat: quibus hic litteris lectis ad urbem confestim

incredibili celeritate advolavit.

Atque ut illius temporis atroci-

tatem recordari possitis, audite litteras et vestram memoriam

ad timoris praeteriti cogitationem excitate.

LITTERAE CICERONIS

extremis diebus consulatus mei res eas quas gesseram vexare cupie-
bant, reliquaeque conjurationis impetus et conatus sunt retardati.

ambitionis . . . qadim] It is strange that
all the interpreters, as Halm observes, ex-
cept Ferratius, could not see that this meant
⁴⁴ not for the purposes of their own interest
or recommending themselves to Sestius.⁷’
At the time of the trial they could get
nothing from Sestius.

vocem] ‘vicem,' Codd.; ‘vocem,’ a friend
of Lambinus; ‘indicem,' Halm, from 311
emendation of Koechly (⁴⁴ qui aliquot egregias
emendationes nobiscum per litteras com-
municavit,’' Halm). The emendation is 111-
genious, but Lambinus’ is simpler, and
perhaps true, and more appropriate. Orelli
explains ⁴ vicem ’ thus: “ hoc decretum
vicem explet officii, quod libenter si licu-
isset ei praestitissent, ut scil. ipsi praesentes
eum laudarent atque ejus salutem depreca-
rentur.⁷’ Klotz in one of his essays or re-
views gives a German version to the same
purport3 and adds a long explanation, on
which Halm says: ‘⁴ Quae praeterea ad
hanc explicationem defendendam satis ver-
bose scripsit, longum est hic repetere.'’
Madvig remarks that ⁴ vicem ' cannot be
used as an adverb here, for it is plain that
the context requires a noun, nor can we
say ‘recitare aliquid vicem alicujus ;’ nor,
110 adds, 0311 11 110 taken as a noun to
express what is substituted in the place of
present duty, for Cicero does not use
¹ vicem ’ before a genitive ; and further, to
calla ‘ decretum ’ by a name which indicates
not what it is, but what it is in the place of,
particularly when we have the words ⁴ me-
moriam‚’ ⁴ praedicationem,’ ⁴ testimonium,’
is, as Madvig says, ‘⁶ prorsus incommodum.”
Lastly‚ he observes that those who adopt

the explanation which 110 is confuting ex-
plain ‘praesentis’ as applying to place,
though it is plain that it is the opposite of
⁴ praeteriti temporis.’

This is very well said, but Klotz and
Bake, as Halm observes, forgetting all this,
devised those explanations by which all the
force of this opposition of past and present
is taken away: “sensit hanc difficultatem
Klotz; quare, ne oppositio illa necessaria
plane tolleretur, callide his verbis usus est 2
⁴ ein Zeugniss fiir die Vergangenheit, ebenso
wie das Decretum vorher als an der Stelle
gegenw'artiger Dienstleistung erscheint ι’
at cum vocabulum {leyenwiirtiy ita nullo
alio significatu nisi quem habet vox anwesend
dictum sit, nemo sanus hac arte fallaci in
fraudem se deduci patietur ’‘ (Halm). Halm
explains ‘vox’ to mean the ⁴expression,'
⁴ the organ 3’ and I think he has done wrong
in replacing the ‘vocem' of his edition
(1845) by the ‘indicem ’ of Koechly in his
edition ot' 1856.

quibus llic litteris] Garatoni observes
that the best authors, as Caesar and par-
ticularly Cicero, are accustomed to repeat
words. But they did not repeat words
simply in order to write them twice (see
Pro Flacco, 0. 35, note).

to south Italy when he heard that Metellus
was a candidate for the tribuncship, and as
he thought that Metellus intended 110 good
to the state, he returned to Rome, and was
elected a tribune (Plutarch, Cato, c. 20).
