376 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

add the following to explain Cicero’s mean-
ing,'’ &a After some words of introduc-
tion he explains thc passage. He translates
‘intermissa die ’ by ⁸ in verschiedenen Fris-
ten,' ‘ at different timcsz’ and the ⁴ quarta
accusatio' is explained thus :—The three
notices on the three several ⁴ nundinae ’ are
to be reckoned as three ‘accusationes‚’ be-
cause notice was givcn of the charge against
the accused, though the trial (judicium)
and the proposal of the penalty (mulctae
irrogatio) could not take place until after
the fourth ‘ accusatio ;’ just as in the other
trials, when double proceedings were al-
lowed, the accusation was made twice, and
not till after the second ‘accusatio ' the de-
cision of the judices was given.

The remark about the double proceedings
in other trials is not to the purpose. The
trial was sometimes adjourned: that is all.
The making the ‘accusatio’ twice is ab·
surd.

Wolf says of Markland and Lambinus,
who could not understand the text : “ puta-
bant nimirum illi h. 1. dicendum fuisse de
judiciorum hujus temporis consuetudine,
non de judiciis ab ipso populo rarius exer-
citis. Sed de his dicere sane placuit Auc-
tori: quae autem profert, tametsi aliqua
veritas et antiquitatis cognitio perlucet, ta-
men sic partim perplexa, partim male La-
tina scripta sunt, ut nusquam vestigium
Ciceronis appareat.’'

denique etiam si qua res . . . sustulit,]
‘⁴ Denique ferri facile posset, si esset aus-
picia aut eoecusatio sustulit.- at quid est
res aliqua sustulit diem aut auspiciis aut
excusatione? Sic neque Livius loquitur
quem huic scriptori lectum esse ex aliquot

locis suspicor, neque alius ullus veterum
scriptorum; nec quisquam eorum tam ridi-
culam facilitatem tollendi judicii quaeren-
daeque impunitatis novit, qualis h. l. de-
scribitur: toea causa judiciumque sublata
est. Quasi dixisset: Solvuntur risu tabulae,
tu missus abibis'' (Wolf). Klotz says on
these words: “ Far from this way of speak-
ing being not Latin, it is rather, with its
genuine Latin distinction of the ideas by
the repetition of aul, altogether in the spirit
of Cicero⁷s way of speaking and of the Ro-
man people.’' He maintains that Hotmann
rightly understood the words ‘tota causa
judiciumque sublatum est‚' which mean that
if it was intended to prosecute a second
time, the prescribed times and other for-
malities must be observed over again3 and
this explanation, he observes, agrees with
what Dion Cassius (37. c. 28) says of this
procedure on the occasion of the prosecu-
tion of Rabirius by Labienus. Klotz fur-
ther remarks that Garatoni misunderstood
the words ‘tota causa judiciumque;' for
‘caussa' means not the ‘factum' only
which was the foundation of the charge,
but merely that which takes place at the
trial for the purpose of the charge and the
penalty3 and accordingly Cicero does not
say-then the accused is for ever free, but
only this—that what has hitherto been done
in the matter and in the trial are at an end.
by which a resuming of the thing itself (rei)
is not excluded, though the thing itself, so
far as it was carried on before the court
(caussa), is no longer in operation.

scurely expressed. He means, “in whom
