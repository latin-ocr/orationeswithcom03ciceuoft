122 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA
dinis comitia. Quare si populo ludorum magnificentia voluptati est,
non est mirandum eam L. Murenae apud populum profuisse. Sed
si nosmetipsi, qni et ab delectatione omni negotiis impedimur, et in
ipsa occupatione delectationes alias multas habere possumus, ludis
tamen oblectamur et ducimur, quid tu admirere de multitudine in-
docta? L. Otho, vir fortis, meus necessarius, equestri ordini resti-
tuit 11011 50111111 dignitatem sed etiam voluptatem. Itaque lex haec,
quae ad ludos pertinet, est omnium gratissima, quod honestissimo
ordini cum splendore fructus quoque jucunditatis est restitutus.
Quare delectant homines, mihicrede, ludi etiam illos qui dissimu-
lant, non solum eos qni fatentur-3 quod ego in mea petitione sensi.
Nam nos quoque habuimus scenam competitricem. Quod si ego,
qni trinos ludos aedilis feceram, tamen Antonii ludis commovebar,
tibi, qui casu nullos feceras, nihil hujus istam ipsam quam irrides
argenteam scenam adversatam putas? Sed haec sane sint paria
omnia: sit par forensis opera militari: sit par militari suffragatio
urbana: sit idem magnificentissimos et nullos umquam fecisse ludos.
Quid in ipsa praetura, nihilne existimas inter tuam et hujus sortem
interfuisse ἕ

(ii. 32) has the same expression. This Lex
caused a great disturbance in Cicero's con-
sulship, which he 1111161611 111 a speech which
is lost (Ad Att. ii. l). Plutarch (Cicero,
c. 13): ‘⁶ In former times those of the
equestrium class were mingled with the
crowd in the theatre, and were spectators
among the people, just as chance would
have it; but M. Otho in his praetorship
was the tirst who sor salte of distinction
separated the equites from the rest of the
citizens and gave 1116111 a particular place,
which they still retain. The people took
this as a disparagement of themselves, and
when Otho appeared in the theatre, thoy
liissecl for the purpose of insulting him, but
1116 equites received him with lond ap-
plause.’' There are two mistakes in this
passage. Otho's name was Lucius, and he
was a ‘tribunus plebis' when he got this

play (Valerius Maximus, ii. 4. (j), as 'we
have just seen by the passage quoted from
Pliny. Plutarch says of Cicero (Cicero, c. 7),
that ‘⁴ he had only a small property, though
sufficient and adequate to his expenses.’'
Cicero (De Off. ii. 17) says that the expense

20. sors —juris dicundi] The lot gave
to Murena the ‘urbana jurisdicti03' or as
Livy (33. c. 21) expresses it: “ Praetore
cujusjurisdictio inter cives erat.’' Cicero
mentions the qualities necessary 111 a Prae-
tor urbanus, equity in his decision, gentle-
ness and patience in listening. In his long
letter to Quintus, when Quintus was go-
vernor of Asia, he gives him good advice
on this head: ‘⁶ Adjungenda etiam est faci-
litas in audiendi), lenitas in decernendo, in
satisfaciendo ac disputando diligentia’' (c. 7).
The ⁶ praetura urbana ' was a “ noble office
and well adapted to prepare the way for the
consulship3 for the reputation that he got
for equity‚ integrity, and good temper was
finally complcted by the entertainment of
his guines.'’
