538 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO
aedes sacras, qui domos inimicorum suorum oppugnavit, excidit,
incendit, qui stipatus semper sicariis, saeptus armatis, munitus
indicibus fuit, quorum hodie copia redundat, qui et peregrinam
manum facinorosorum concitavit et servos ad caedem idoneos emit
et in tribunatu carcerem totum in forum effudit, volitat aedilis, ac—
cusat eum, qui aliqua ex parte ejus furorem exsultantem repressit:
hic, qui se est tutatus sic ut in privata re deos penates suos, in re
publica jura tribunatus atque auspicia defenderet, accusare eum
moderate, a quo ipse nefarie accusatur, per senatus auctoritatem
non est situs.

Nimirum hoc illud est, quod de me potissimum tu in accusatione
quaesisti, quae esset nostra natio optimatiun1; sic enim dixisti.
Rem quaeris praeclaram juventuti ad discendum nec mihi difficilem
ad perdocendum, de qua pauca, judices, dicam: et, ut arbitror,
nec ab utilitate eorum qui audient, nec ab officio vestro nec ab ipsa
caussa P. Sestii abhorrebit oratio mea. XLV. Duo genera semper
in hac civitate fuerunt eorum qui versari in re publica atque in ea
se excellentius gerere stud11e1·11nt; quibus ex generibus alteri se
populare& alteri optimates et haberi et esse voluerunt, Qui ea quae
faciebant quaeque dicebant multitudini jucunda volebant esse, popu-
lares; qui autem ita se gerebant, ut sua consilia optimo cuique

rally, especially in the Ordo Senatorius, no

Milo (Ad Att. iv. 3) (Manutius).—‘ per
small number of Ultra-Tories, as Cicero,

senatus auctoritatem ι’ c. 41.

Nimirum lmc illud est,] Milo was prc-
vented from prosecuting Clodius by the
⁴ auctoritas ’ of the Senate; and this was a
judgment of the Senate in favour of Clodius
and against Milo, or it might be viewed as
an expression of the opinion of the ‘ sum-
mus ordo' in favour of Clodius. The ac-
cusator had said something contemptuously
about the ‘natio optimatium,' whom Cicero
assumed to be with him, while the ‘ aucto-
ritas ’ of the Senate was against him3 and
Cicero takes the opportunity of saying who
the Optimates are.

45. studuerwzt,·] Ernesti proposed ‘ stude-
rent,’ which would plainly spoil the sense;
for as Wunder, cited by Halm, observes,
‘ii qui studuerunt' arc a definite class,
and they are here divided into two parts.

populares . . . optimales] See Vol. Ι.
Verr. ii. 5. c. 6, note on ‘populares aut
nobiles;’ and Vol. ΙΙ. De Leg. Agr. ii.4;
and Becker (Haudbuch der Rom. Alt. ii. l,
p.‘233) who says that “the Roman Optimates
did not exactly correspond to the descrip-
tion in this chapter-3 there were at least
different fractions among them, aud natu-

Pro Cluentio, c. 55, admirably paints them:
‘ii qui se volunt posse omnia‚’'’ &c., and
the note (Vol. ΙΙ.). The Germans show
their newly got knowledge of political life
by modernizing antiquity, which is just as
if a Paris milliner should dress the Venus
of Milo in the fashion of the day.
Machiavelli understood these things
better. He was a man of sense and of
great experieuce (Istor. Fiorent. iv.). States,
and especially those which are not well
constituted, which are administered under
the name of Republics, osten change their
government and condition, but the fluc-
tuation is not between liberty and servitude,
as many suppose, but between servitude
and licence. It is only the name of liberty
which is in the mouth of the ministers of
licence who are the popular leaders, and the
ministers of servitude who are the nobles:
both of them wish to be subject neither to
the laws nor to mem—This is the true
character of a Popular and an Aristocratic
party, or whatever is the name by which
the opposite to Popular is better marked.
