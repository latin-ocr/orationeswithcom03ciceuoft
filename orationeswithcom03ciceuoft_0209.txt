CAP. 25, 26. 195

audacius, sed quod cuiquam paullo minus consideratum videretur?
Factum quaero? verbum ecquod umquam ex ore hujus excidit, in
quo quisquam posset offendi? At vero in illa gravi L. Sullae
turbulentaque victoria quis P. Sulla mitior, quis misericordior
inventus est? Quam multorum hic vitam esta L. Sulla deprecatus,
quam multi sunt summi homines et ornatissimi et nostri et equestris
ordinis, quorum pro salute se hic Sullae obligavit? Quos ego nomi-
narem, neque enim ipsi nolunt, et huic animo gratissimo adsunt, sed
quia majus est beneficium quam posse debet civis civi dare, ideo a
vobis peto ut quod potuit tempori tribuatis, quod fecit ipsi. Quid
reliquam constantiam vitae commemorem, dignitatem, liberalitatem,
moderationem in privatis rebus, splendorem in publicis? quae ita a
fortuna deformata sunt ut tamen a natura inchoata compareant.
Quae domus, quae celebratio quotidiana, quae familiarium dignitas,
quae studia amicorum, quae ex quoque ordine multitudo? Haec diu
multumque et multo labore quaesita una eripuit- hora. Accepit
P. Sulla, judices, vulnus vehemens et mortiferum, verumtamen
ejusmodi qnod videretur hujus vita et natura accipere potuisse.

minus consideratum] Sec Pro Caecina,
e. l.—‘in quo quisquam? ‘unde quis-
quam,' Orelli. T. B. and one oxon. have
⁴ in quo.’

quis-micion] It may be true that P.
Sulla saved men's lives, and he may not
have been cruel. But Cicero tells us in
another place and at a later period of 1115
life (Introd.) that P. Sulla enriched himself
by the purehase of the property of the pro-
scribed.

Quam mullorum] The ‘quam ' is found
in Gellius, who quotes this passage (vi. 16)
35 311 example of one signification of ‘de-
precaris He says of ‘deprecari ’ in this
sense: “quod Graeci propria (propinqua)
significatione παραιτοῦμαι di‹:unt.”

obliqui-il ι’] He means that he undertook
or engaged to L. Sulla that these men would
never disturb him. He saved their lives
by promising for them. The obligation
111115 contracted is so called froin its re-em-
blance to a pecuniary ¹ obligatio, ’ in which
1116 surety pays when the primipal voann 1.
Sylvius compares a passage in the 111111
philippic (1. 18) 111 which Cicero pledgts
his (redit 10 1116 Roman people for tho
fidelity of 0.tax1anus.‘Au‹1tb0 etiam
obligare 11116111 ineam, Patres conscripti, vo-
bis populoque Romano -promitto, recipio.
spondeo‚'' διο. Cicero afterwards repented
of this ‘obligatio,' as he says to Brutus,
where he very wisely remarks z “est autem

O

gravior et difficilior animi et sententiae,
maximis praesertim in rebus, pro altero
quam pecuniae obligatio.'’

ita α sormunt] Here we have the ‘ita'
and‘ ut’ again (c. 15). All these thingsin
Sulla have been disfigured by his bad fortune,
but still there remain the 011111 1165 of that.
which nature beg ⁰:an as 11 116 were speaking
of a handsome face which illness or sorrow
had impaired without destroying the original
form.

quae celebratio quotidiana] What daily
crowding to his house in the time of his
prosperity; what elevated rank in his in-
timate 3550613165.> Orelli has ‘familiaris
dignitas‚’ which Sylvius explains by ‘ non
fa÷tuosa‚ non superba;’ but I don't under-
stand that. T. B. have ‘familiarium ;’ the
rest have ‘ 1311111131151.1 One hour, the hour
of his conviction‚ cleared Sulla‘s house of
his friends, when he would learn what the
poet knew by experience(Ovid,Trist. 1 ,9) :—

⁶ Donec eris felix multos numerabis ami-
cos,
Tempora quum fuerint nubila, solus eris.’'

hujus vila] T. B.; ⁴ liujus vit-aff Halm.
The rest have ‘ ejus? He received a wour‘d
by his conviction in the trial ‘de ainbitu,’
but still it was a wound that his life and
natural character could bear. He was not
quite ruined3 but a conviction in the pre-
sent trial would be complete ruin.
