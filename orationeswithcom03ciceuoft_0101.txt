CAP. 11. 87

XI. Quae quum ita sint, [patres conscripti,] pro imperio, pro
exercitu, pro provincia quam neglexi, pro triumpho ceterisque
laudis insignibus, quae sunt a me propter urbis vestraeque salutis
custodiam repudiata, pro clientelis hospitiisque provincialibus, quae
tamen urbanis opibus non minore labore tueor quam comparo ς pro
his igitur omnibus rebus, pro meis in vos singularibus studiis proque
1136 quam conspicitis ad conservandam rem publicam diligentia
nihil a vobis nisi hujus temporis totiusque mei consulatus memo-
riam postulo, quae dum erit in vestris fixa mentibus, firmissimo me
muro saeptum esse arbitrabor. Quod si meam spem vis improborum
fefellerit atque superaverit, commendo vobis parvum meum filium,
6111 profecto satis erit praesidii non solum ad salutem verum etiam
ad dignitatem, si ejus qui 11366 omnia suo solius periculo conser-
varit illum esse filium memineritis. Quapropter de summa salute
vestra populique Romani, de vestris conjugibus 36 liberis, de aris
36 focis, de fanis ac templis, de totius urbis tectis 36 sedibus, de
imperio 36 libertate, de salute Italiae, de universa re publica
decernite diligenter ut instituistis, 36 sortiter. Habetis [enim]
eum consulem qui et parere vestris decretis non dubitet, et ea
quae statueritis quoad vivet defendere et per se ipsum praestare
possit.

a hired actor, to play a second part to him-
self on behalf of his country.” Cicero says

further, in a letter to M. Cato (Ad Fam. xv,
4. l3)z ‘⁶ Testis est consulatus meus—Ita-

11. pro provincia] “According to the
Lex Sempronia de provinciis consularibus
(11.6. 122) it was the business of the Senate
before the consular 6166110115 to determine

the provinces to which the consuls should
go after the termination of their consulship,
and the consuls then cast lots for their re-
spective provinceS, or agreed about thern.
At this time Antonius had got Gallia Cis—
alpina, and Cicero had got Macedonia, a
province which gave him the expwtation of
atriumph and 3 rich booty. Ionvever, in
order to draw off Antonius from his con-
nexion with Catilina, Cicero gave up to
him his province of Macedonia, and then
renounced 1116 province of Gallia; as he
says in a letter to Atticus (ii. l): “Oratio
sexta consularis quum provinciam in con-
tione deposui.” Plutarch (Cicero, c. 12)
says: ‘⁴ It was supposed also that Antonius
was 111-(1113101611 with the designs of Catilina,
and was not averse to them on account of
the magnitude of his ‹lebts, which chiefly
gave alarm to the noblcS. And this was 1116
first object that Cicero directed his attention
1ος and hc caused the province of Macedonia.
to be given to Antonius, and Gaul, which
was offered to himself, 116 declincd3 and by
these favours he gained over Antonius, like

que et provinciam ornatam et spem non
dubiam triumphi neglexi '¹ (Halm).

clientelis] The towns of the provinces
often made 3 governor their ‘patronus’ when
he left them3 if he was 3 111311 111 whom
they had confidence. Many instances are
easily collected of distinguished Romans
being the Patroni of 3 province or of par-
ticular towns. Cicero gained the good will
of the Sicilians during his quaestorship, and
the Sicilians chose him as their ‘patronus ⁹
in the prosecution of Verres. This selection
of a man by 3 whole country or by a town
to protect their interests was an honour to
the man who was selected, and gave him
intluenre at Rome. The origin of this may
have been what Cicero (De Off. i. c. ll)
says it was: ‘⁴ In quo tanto opere apud
11051105 justitia culta est ut ii qui civitates
aut nationes devictas bello in fidem recepis-
sent, earum patroni essent more majorum.”
(Halm.)

(Ie memma salute] Tnis may be compared
with the expression ⁴ summa res publica.’
