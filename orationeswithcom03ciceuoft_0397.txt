OAP. 21—23. 383

dicendo non possem explicare. An quia caussam probare non
poteram, cujus tanta bonitas est ut ea ipsa non modo se, sed
etiam me absentem per se probarit? An senatus, an ordines, an
ii qui cuncta ex Italia ad me revocandum convolaverunt, segniores
me praesente ad me retinendum et conservandum fuissent in ea
caussa, quam ipse jam parricida talem dicat fuisse, ut me ab
omnibus ad meam pristinam dignitatem expectatum atque revoca-
tum queratur? An vero in judicio periculi nihil fuit, privilegium
pertimui, ne, mihi praesenti si mulcta irrogaretur, nemo inter-
cederet? Tam inops autem ego eram ab amicis aut tam nuda res
publica a magistratibus? Quid, si vocatae tribus essent, pro-
scriptionem, non dicam in me ita de sua salute merito, sed omnino
in ullo civi comprobavissent? An si ego praesens fuissem, veteres
illae copiae conjuratorum tuique perditi milites atque egentes et nova
vis sceleratissimorum consulum corpori meo pepercissent? qui
quum eorum omnium crudelitati scelerique cessissem, ne absens
quidem luctu meo mentes illorum satiare potui.

XXIII. Quid enim vos uxor mea misera violarat, quam vexa-
vistis‚ raptavistis‚ omni crudelitate lacerastis? Quid mea filia,
cujus fletus assiduus sordesque lugubres vobis erant jucundae,
ceterorum omnium mentes oculosque flectebant? Quid parvus

‘illorum‚' G. M.: ‘eorum,' P., Baiter.
23. αῖον mea] Comp. Pro Sestio, c. 24:
“vexabatur uxor mea‚” &c., and c. 693

eoepectatum] Graevius says that one
MS. had ‘ expetitum,’ as it is in the edition
of Manutius of 1583, which Manutius got

from Ursini, who remarks that Pantagathus
read ⁴ expetitum! Baiter does not men-
tion this, which may be the true reading.
An vero] “Was it the fact that there
was no danger in a trial, and that I was
afraid of a ‘ privilegium’ and there being
no tribune to interpose‚ ifa fine was pro-
posed to be put on me ?” Baiter points it
thus: ‘An vero . . . nihil fuit: privilegium ’
&c., but I do not understand that. Grae-
vius thinks that it ought to be ‘ An vero si
in judicio,' and so it seems. Wolf remarks
that the writer had before him a passage in
the Pro Milone, c. 14: “ Diem mihi, credo,
dixerat, multam irrogarat, actionem per-
duellionis intenderat.’'
nova vis . . . consulum]
Graevius, Baiter. Cod. Francianus primus
has ‘ non manus ' (Baiter), which may
mean ‘nova manus.' Graevius says that
the MS. has ¹ nova manus.’ P. (pr. manu)
has ‘ nova ΙΙ nus.’ But ‘ nova manus con-
sulum ' is strange. It is not like ‘nova per-
ditorum hominum manus' which Graevius

⁴ Nova manus, ’

quotes from Florus, ii. 10; nor is ‘ magna
vis consulum ’ like ‘magna vis hominum!—

and Ad Fam. xiv. 2. His little son, six or
seven years of age, was always crying. He
was ‘ lacrimans et consectus.' ‘ Confectus ⁷
is generally used with an ablative, as ‘ vul-
neribus confectus‚' but it is used thus in the
orations against Catilina, ii. ll ε “ gladiatori
illi confecto et saucio.'' All this is said
⁴ oratorie! Wolf remarks ‘⁴ that the writer's
impetuosity from the beginning of this chap-
ter carried him so much into plurals that
he seems to have forgotten that he was
addressing the Pontifices, unless perchance
the faction of Clodius and the wicked con-
suls was assembled in some place, so that
he might turn his eyes and his hands in
that direction :” which, I think, is not pro-
bable. But he addresses Clodius all through
this speech as if he were present. Klotz
says that no body will take ofl'ence at this
who knows Cicero's way of speaking; and
that such apostrophes certainly did not
seem strange to the court of Pontifices.
We can only say they must have been very
patient to listcn to so much rant about a
matter which was foreign to the question,
the orator’s house.
