c. 10). Sallust charges him with murdering his own son before he

married Aurelia Orestilla, who refused his suit until the young man was
put out of the way.

In Rc. (58 Catilina was elected a Praetor, and in the next year he had
the province of Africa as Propraetor. He was in Rome in Bc. 66,
where he came to canvass for the consulship, but having had notice of a
prosecution for maladministration in his province, he was compelled to
retire from the field, either because he could not be a candidate under
such circumstances, or because he knew that the presiding consuls
would not return him as elected, even if he had the majority of votes
(Sallust, Cat. 183 Becker, Handbuch, ἕω, ii. 2, p. 33, δια).

The consuls elected for B.c. 65, P. Autronius Paetus and P. Cornelius
Sulla, were prosecuted for bribery and convicted, upon which L. Aurelius
Cotta and L. Manlius Torquatus were elected consuls. Catilina and
Autronius being joined by Cn. Calpurnius Piso, a young patrician,
formed a design to murder the two consuls on the first of January, and
many of the most distinguished senators during the celebration of
religious worship on the capitol. Their design was to assume the con-
sular power, and to send Piso with a force to take possession of the
Spanish provinces (Sallust, Cat. c. 18, 193 Cicero, In Cat. i. c. 6). The
conspiracy having become known, the execution of it was deferred to
the fifth of February, but it failed then also. Though the facts were
notorious, the Senate did not investigate them, and nobody brought the
conspirators to trial.

In this year Catilina was tried for maladministration (Repetunda-

rum) in his province of Africa. The prosecutor was P. Clodius Pulcher.
’ Cicero was asked to defend Catilina, and we know from one of his own
letters that he did not refuse (Ad Att. i. 2). It is not certain whether
he did defend him or not, but if we can draw any conclusion from
his letter, thc conclusion is that he did defend him. Asconius says that
Fenestella states that Cicero did defend Catilina, but Asconius infers
from Cicero's oration In Toga candida (Ascon. ed. Orelli, p. 85) that
Fenestella was mistaken. The consul L. Torquatus helped Catilina on
his trial (Pro Sulla, c. 29). Some of the Judices were bribed and
voted for the acquittah the equites and tribuni aerarii, as Asconius
says. The Senatorial judices voted against him. It was a scandalous
affair3 and Clodius himself, the prosecutor, was guilty of Praevari-
cation (Rein, Das Criminalrecht der Romen p. 632). Drumann
(Geschichtc Roms, v. p. 411) maintains that Cicero defended Catilina
on this occasion3 and, as already observcd‚ there are good reasons
for thinking that hc did. But, as Drumann justly says, “as to our
estimato of Cicero’s moral worth, it is quite immaterial whether he did
or did not do what he intended.'’ He knew Catilina well. He believed
