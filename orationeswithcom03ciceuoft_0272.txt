258 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

tabulas falsas esse voluerunt, nam servos novem se professi sunt
habere, quum omnino sine comite venissent. Decreto scribendo
primum video affuisse Lysaniam 3 cujus fratris bona, quod [is] populo
non solvebat, praetore Flacco publice venierunt. Praeterea Phi-
lippus est, Lysaniae gener, et Hermobius, cnjus frater Poles item
pecuniae publicae est condemnatus. XIX. Dicunt se Flacco et iis
qui simul essent drachmarum xv millia dedisse. Cum civitate mihi
res est acerrima et conficientissima litterarum, in qua nummus
commoveri nullus potest sine quinque praetoribus, tribus quaestori-
bus, quattuor mensariis, qui apud illos a populo creantur. Ex hoc
tanto numero deductus est nemo; et quum illam pecuniam nomi-
natim Flacco datam referant, majorem [etiam] aliam quum huic
eidem darent, in aedem sacram reficiendam se perscripsisse dicunt;
quod minime convenit. Nam aut onmia occulte referenda fuerunt
aut aperte omnia. Quum perscribunt Flacco nominatim, nihil
timent, nihil verentur; quum operi publico referunt, iidem homines
subito eundem quem contempserant pertimescunt. Si praetor dedit,
ut est scriptum, a quaestore numeravit, quaestor a mensa publica,
mensa aut ex vectigali aut ex tributo. Numquam erit istuc simile
criminis, nisi hanc mihi totam rationem omni et personarum genere
et litterarum explicaris. Vel quod est in eodem decreto scriptum,

populo non solz-ebat,] He was a debtor lio propinqui minore centesimis nummum

to his state some way, and as he did not
pay, he was sold up during Flaccus' praetor-
ship, and as we may assume by Flaccus’
order, or with his consent 3 and so he would
be the praetor’s enemy. Cicero looking at
the documents says ‘ Decreto scribendo
primum video affuisse Lysaniam 3’ the
names or ‘ auctoritates,’ as they were called,
of those who were present when the in-
strument was reduced to form were prefixed
to it. This was also the Roman fashion in
reducing to form the Decreta and Consulta
of the senate.

19. qui simul essent] See Pro Sulla, c.
7.—‘ conficientissima litteraru1n‚’ most care-
fulin its money accounts3 and so it ap-
pears. They knew their own knavery, and
took care that none of themselves could lay
hold of the public money—‘deductus est
nemo :’ none of them was brought as a
witness to Rome. See c. 15 : “ non deduxi,
inquit, Sextilium.''——‘ commoveri ε’ ⁴ moveri
nullus‚' S. A. Compare Pro Fonteio, c. 5:
‘⁴ nummus in Gallia nullus sine civium Ro-
manorum tabulis commmeturff’ The Ro-
mans often used ⁴ movere ' in this sense, as
in the letters to Atticus (i. 12) : ‘⁴ A Caeci-

movere non possunt.”

huic eidem] Faernus, in place of‘ huic
idem ' or ⁴ huic iidem.'

perscripsisse] This means the entry in
the public books. Cicero’s argument is
this: No public money can be paid at
Temnus except with the strictest form. If
they entered one sum of money with great
exaetness and set it down as applied to a
public work (operi publico referunt), why
did they not do so with the other? When
they enter a sum of money as paid to
Flaccus on his account (nominatim), they
use no precautions3 a single praetor, as
they say, paid it. When they enter the
money as paid to Flaccus for a public pur-
pose, they then show their sear of the man,
of whom before they had none (quem con-
tempserant), by using all the precautions
that- their law required.

α quaestore] He paid it through the
quaestor (ταμιας). He gave an order to
the quaest0r3 the quaestor gave an order
on the public treasurer or banker (τραπε-
ζίτης), and he could only get the money
eithe,r from the ‘vectigal' or the ‘tribu-
tum.
