60 ORAT. ΙΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

ex memoria vobis, Quirites, quid senatus censuerit exponam. Pri-
mum mihi gratiae verbis amplissimis aguntur, quod virtute, consilio,
providentia mea res publica periculis sit maximis liberata: deinde
L. Flaccus et C. Pomptinus praetores, quod eorum opera forti
fidelique usus essem, merito 30 jure laudantur3 atque etiarn viro
forti, collegae meo, laus impertitur, quod eos qui hujus conjurationis
participes fuissent a suis et a rei publicae consiliis removisset.
Atque ita censuerunt, ut P. Lentulus quum se praetura abdicasset
in custodiam traderetur: itemque uti C. Cethegus, L. Statilius,
P. Gabinius, qui omnes praesentes erant, in custodiam traderentur:
atque idem hoc decretum est in L. Cassium qui sibi procurationem
incendendae urbis depoposcerat; in M. Caeparium, cui ad sollici-
tandos pastores Apuliam attributam esse erat indicatum; in
P. Furium qui est ex iis colonis quos Faesulas L. Sulla deduxit3
in Q. Manlium Chilonem qui una cum hoc Furio semper erat in
1130 Allobrogum sollicitatione versatus3 in P. Umbrenum, liberti-
num hominem, a quo primum Gallos ad Gabinium perductos esse
constabat. Atque ea lenitate senat-us usus est, Quirites, ut ex
tanta conjuratione tantaque 1130 multitudine domesticorum hos-

discussed the cases mentioned 111 Livy, iii.

colle-que mem] This was C. Antonius, a
‘vir fortis‚' as Cicero calls him, an honest

man3 but Cicero knew that he was not.
Catilina had expected Antonius’ support.
Antonius had done nothing in the city in
the affair of the conspiracy; no mention is
made of Cicero consulting him. It would
be almost a certain conclusion from'Cicero's
words that he was not in Rome3 and Sallust
(Cat. 0. 36) says that the Senate, on hearing
of Catilina having arrived in Manlius’ camp,
ordered the consuls 10 raise troops, and
Antonius to follow Catilina with 311 army,
while Cicero watched over the city.
abdic-assa] ‘⁴ At length the Senate hav·
ing by a vote promised a pal-don to the man
of Croton 011 condition 01 1115 giving infor-
mation, Lentulus being convicted abdicated
his office, for 110 happened to be praetor,
and laying down his robe with the purple
hem before the senate, assumed a dress
suitable to the occasion ” (Plutarch, Cicero,
c. 19). A Roman could not he tried while
he held a magistratum nor could he be
deprived of his 011100. There is however an
instance recorded by Plutarch (Tib. Grac-
chus, c. 12) of a tribune Octavius being
depriw d of his 011100 hy a vote of the trihcs
on the proposal of Ti. Gravehus3 but this
was irregular. In the instance of this Len-
tulus there was a show of voluntary resigna-

tion. Examples of abdication are collected

⁴293 v. 9 3 Dionys. Hal. x. 353 Livy⁷ viii. 36.
The expression is ‘se magistratu abdicare,'
to detach himself from the office. Lentulus
was put in ‘libera custodia ’ (Sallust, Cat.
c. 47). The old rule about a magistratus
not being liable to be tried during 1115 office
is preserved 111 311 excerpt in the Digest
(⁵2. 4. 2) from Ulpian: ‘⁵ In jus vocari non
oportet neque consulem neque praefectum
neque praetorem neque proconsulem neque
ceteros magistratus qui imperium habent, et
qui coercere aliquem possunt, et jubere in
carcerem duci.''

Q. B1anlium Chilonem] This is the
MSS. reading, which Halm has altered to
‘ Q. Annium Chilonem,⁷ who is twice 111011-
tioned by Sallust (Cat. c. 17. 50). Q. Cicero
(De petit. consul. ξ 10) 3150 says: “ Qui
(Catilina) ex curia Curios et Annios—sibi
amicissimos comparavit..” The mistake in
the MSS. of Cicer0, if it is a mistake, is
supposed to have arisen from the name of
the centurion Manlius having been so often
mentioned.
