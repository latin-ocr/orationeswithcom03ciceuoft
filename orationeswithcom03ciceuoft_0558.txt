544 oRAT. PRO P. SESTIO

J ucunda res plebei3 victus enim suppeditabatur large sine labore.
Repugnabant boni, quod et ab industria plebem ad desidiam avo-
cari putabant et aerarium exhauriri videbatur.

XLIX. Multa etiam nostra memoria, quae consulto praetereo,
fuerunt in ea contentione, ut popularis cupiditas a consilio prin-
cipum dissideret. Nunc jam nihil est quod populus a delectis
principibusque dissentiat; nec flagitat rem ullam neque novarum
rerum est cupidus et otio suo et dignitate optimi cujusque et uni-
versae rei publicae gloria delectatur. Itaque homines seditiosi ac
turbulenti, quia nulla Jam largitione populum Romanum concitare
possunt, quod plebes perfuncta gravissimis seditionibus ac discordiis
otium amplexatur, conductas habent contiones; neque id agunt
ut ea dicant aut ferant quae illi velint audire qui in contione sunt,
sed pretio ac mercede perficiunt ut quidquid dicant, id illi velle
audire videantur. Num vos existimatis Gracchos aut Saturninum
aut quemquam illorum veterum, qui populares habebantur, ullum
umquam in contione habuisse conductum? Nemo habuit. Ipsa
enim largitio et spes commodi propositi sine mercede ulla multi-
tudinem concitabat. Itaque temporibus illis, qui populares erant,
offendebant illi quidem apud graves et honestos homines, sed populi
judiciis atque omni significatione florebant. His in theatro plau-
debat-un hi suffragiis quod contenderant consequebantur, horum
homines nomen, orationem, vultum, incessum amabant. Qui autem

Frumentariae are correctly described, Cicero
has touched on a great political evil. To
supply abundantly the means of living with-
out labour is the way to encourage idleness.
It seems that these distributions of corn
and sales of corn at a price lower than the

founded on the readings ‘ malexatur,' ⁶ ma-
leuexatur,' and ⁴ malelaxatur!

Num vos eoeistimatis, &c.] Rubino,
quoted by Halm, says that even Cato after-
wards approved of money being distributed
among the people (Sueton. Jul. c. 19). The

market price were not intended solely to
relieve the poor, but were means of getting
popularity and votes. Ι do not know that
there is any thing to show that this distri-
bution was made to any except those who
were in Rome, but the number was large at
this time: in the thirteenth consulship of
Augustus two hundred thousand persons or
something more (Dion 54. c. 15; Monu-
mentum Ancyranum).

videbatur] ⁴¹ ‘videbant’ Momms, Halm
<2); ‘videbantur' P . G¹.; ‘videbatur’ P2.
G².'' (Halm).

49. nostra memoria,] As we say, within
the memory of man, an expression which
will comprehend all the period from Cicero's
birth to the time when he is speaking.—
‘ Nunc jam :’ ‘jam’ marks the emphasis on
the time ‘ nunc.'

ampleoeatuffl An emendation of Madvig,

occasion on which Suetonius tells us this
was Caesar's election for the consulship.
Caesar made a coalition with Lucceius, one
os the candidates, on the terms that Luc-
ceius, who was less popular than Caesar,
should supply all the money to bribe the
electors. Upon this the Optimates, who
were afraid of what Caesar would do in his
consulship, if he had a colleague like him-
self, advised Bibulus who was the third
candidate to promise as much, ‘⁴ and most
of them contributed money, and even Cato
did not deny that this bribery was for the
interest of the state.” All this belongs to
the subject ofbribery at elections3 and it is
instructive. Here Cicero is speaking of a
different thing.

populi judiciis] This means by the
opinions which the people showed on such
occasions, as he afterwards mentions.
