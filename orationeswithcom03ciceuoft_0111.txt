GAP. 12, 3. 97

diantur, quo tandem me esse animo oportet, prope jam ex magna
jactatione terram videntem, in hunc cui video maximas rei publicae
tempestates esse subeundas? Quare si est boni consulis non solum
videre quid agatur, verum etiam providere quid futurum sit, osten-
dam alio loco, quantum salutis communis intersit duos consules in
re publica Kalendis J an. esse. Quod si ita est, non tam me
officium debuit ad hominis amici fortunas quam respublica con-
sulem ad communem salutem defendendam vocare.

III. Nam quod legem de ambitu tuli, certe ita tuli ut eam quam
mihimet ipsi jampridem tulerim de civium periculis defendendis non
abrogarem. Etenim si largitionem factam esse confiterer, idque
recte factum esse defenderem, facerem improbe, etiam si alius legem
tulisset, quum vero nihil commissum contra legem esse defendam,
quid est quod meam defensionem latio legis impediat? Negat esse
ejusdem severitatis Catilinam exitium rei publicae intra moenia
molientem verbis et paene imperio urbe expulisse, et nunc pro
L. Murena dicere. Ego autem has partes lenitatis et misericordiae,
quas me natura ipsa docuit, semper egi libenter, illam vero gravi-
tatis severitatisque personam non appetivi, sed ab re publica mihi
impositam sustinui, sicut hujus imperii dignitas in summo periculo
civium postulabat. Quod si tum quum res publica vim et severita-
tem desiderabat, vici naturam et tam vehemens fui quam cogebar,

Kalendis [απ] This shows that the
oration was delivered before the first of
January, on which day the new consuls en-
tered on their office. (Compare c. 37.)
Manutius infers from the words ‘pericula
quibus nos perfuncti‚' that this speech was
delivered aster the fifth of December, the
day on which the conspirators were executed;
but the conclusion is not certain. He says
indeed that it concerns the common interest
that there should be two consuls on the first
of January, and there would only be one if
Murena was convicted, unless another could
be elected immediately. If the speech was
delivered before the fifth of December, there
was plenty of time to elect a new consul.
However nothing is so insecure as a con-
clusion derived from Cicero’s general ex-
pressions ; and we know that Murena voted
for the punishment of the conspirators.
Indeed it is plain from c. 37. 39 of this
oration that the conspirators in the city
were not yet apprehended. See also the
oration Pro Domo, c. 5⁶2.

3. qnam mihimet ipsi] He first uses the
expression ‘ legem tuli ’ in the proper sense:
‘ I proposed aud carried a lex‚’ for it means

ΥΟΕ. 111.

311 that. He then uses it in the improper
sense when he says ‘¹ quam mihimet ipsi—
tulerim‚⁷’ “the law which 1 imposed on
myself,” his resolution to defend his fellow-
citizens. &Vesenberg conjectures that we
should write ‘abrogarim3’ and Halm says
‘ probabiliter.’ I think not.

Catilinamssz-erbis] See the Introduction
to the Orations In Catilinam; and In Cat.
ii. c. 6. This passage shows that the speech
was made after the eighth of November,
when Catilina left Rome. (Introd.)

personam] Cicero often uses this word,
which, it is generally said, is taken from the
stage. It is not material whether this be
true or not. The word signified a human
being as invested with a certain character or
office, aud hence it has a legal signification.
(Vol. I. Verr. ii. 2. c. 17.) He sayS, Pro
Archia (e. 2): “Et in ejusmodi persona
quae propter otium ac studium minime in
judiciis periculisque tractata est uti prope
novo quodam et inusitato genere dicendi.''
He uses the word again in the oration Pro
Sulla, c. 3: ‘⁶ Hanc mihi tu si propter res
meas gestas imponis in omni vita mea per-
sonam.’'
