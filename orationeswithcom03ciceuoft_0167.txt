ORATION FOR P. SULLA.

IN the beginning of Bc. 62 L. Sergius Catilina lost his life in a battle
in which his troops were defeated by the forces of the Republic (Introd.
to the Orations against Catilina). This defeat was followed by the
prosecution of some of his partizans under the Lex Plautia de Vi (Dion
Cassius, 37. c. 413 Declamatio Pseudo-Sallustii in Ciceronem, c. 2:
‘⁶ quum Legis Plautiae judicia domi faciebatis’'). The Lex Plautia was
probably enacted in B.c. 89 (Vol. ii. p. 140). Among the various
offences punishable by this Lex was the crime of rioting (seditio) and
disturbing the public peace. The penalty seems to have been exile.
But the provisions of this Lex and of another Lex de Vi which was
enacted eleven years later, Lex Lutatia, are not well ascertained.
(Orelli, Index Legum, Lex Plotia de Vi3 Rein, Das Criminalrecht der
Romer, p. 738.) Cicero (Pro Sulla, c. 2) mentions several of those who
were prosecuted and convicted under the Lex Plautia. In the year
Ro. 62, as it appears (c. 33), L. Manlius Torquatus, son of the Torquatus
who was consul in Bc. 65, prosecuted P. Cornelius Sulla under the Lex
Plautia de Vi, and P. Cornelius, the son of an Eques C. Cornelius, who
had been convicted under this Lex, was the Subscriptor (Pro Sulla,
c. 18).

This P. Cornelius Sulla was a kinsman of the Dictator Sulla, as
Cicero says (De Off. ii. c. 8). Dion Cassius (36. c. 27) calls him a
nephew of the Dictator3 and it is generally assumed that he is the
P. Cornelius Sulla who is mentioned by Sallust (Cat. c. 17) as one of
those who attended Catilina’s meeting in the consulship of L. Cacsar
and C. Figulus, Rc. 642 (P. et Servius Sullae). lf this is so, Sallust
makes P. Cornelius Sulla as guilty as Lentulus and CetheguS, and yet
Cicero affirms that there was no evidence of his being implicated in
Catilina’s conspiracy. And, as Halm remarks, it is proved by the correct
reading of a passage in this oration (c. 2: “Quis nostrum Servium
