POETA OAP. 10, 11. 227

per Lucullos impetravisset? qui praesertim usque eo de suis rebus

Lucullos] The mother of L. and M.
Luculli was a Caecilia, and Metellus was a
Caecilius. When Pius was conducting the
war in Spain against Sertorius, he gave the
civitas to Q. Fabius of Saguntum (Pro Bal-
bo, c. 22). A Roman or Italian population
was settled at Corduba (Cordova) ou the
Baetis (Guadalquiver) in Spain in the second
century B.c. ς and the Roman language was
planted in Spain. These poets of Corduba
were however of no great repute, as Cicero
says3 they were coarse and tasteless men.
After Cicero's time Lucan and the two
Senecae came from Corduba.

The ‘pingue quiddam' is what Cicero
(Orator, c. 8) calls “opimum quoddam et
tamquam adipale dictionis genus.'' ‘ Sonare'
is a poetical word, as Horace has it:

 

atque os
(Sat. i. 4, v. 43.)

These Corduban poets were‘ crassa Minerva.'
Seneca (Suasor. vii. a.) quoted by Baiter:
“ Sextilius Hena fuit homo ingeniosus magis
quam eruditus, inaequalis poeta et paene
quibusdam locis talis quales esse Cicero
Cordubenses poetas ait. pingue quiddam so-
nantes atque peregrinum.’'

ll. quod obscurari] ‘Which cannot be
concealed.' Men cannot conceal their love
of fame.

illis lihellz's.] Baiter and Halm have
¹ in iis,' which is Madvig's alteration. But
Cicero repeats the prononn, ‘Ipsi illi . . .
illis libellis! The preposition ⁴ in ’ may be
wanting. The passage is quoted by Am-
mianus Marcellinus (xxii. 7), and stands

Magna sonaturum.”

thus in J. Gronovius’ edition : “Ipsi illi phi-
losophi etiam in his libris quos de contem-
nenda gloria scribunt, nomen suum inscri-
bunt, ut in eo ipso quo praedicationem 110-
bilitatemque despiciunt praedicari de se ac
se nominari velint.'' Perhaps ‘se’ ought
to be inserted before ‘ nominari ' in Cicero's
text.

The readings in this passage show how
the critics handle things. G. E. P. have
‘etiam illis;' and A. has ‘etiam in illis.’
The repetition of ‘ 1111 ’ is emphatic. Baiter
quotes Cicero, Tusc. (i. c. 15) : ‘⁶ Quid nostri
philosophi, nonne in iis (his ?)lib1·is ipsis quos
scribunt de contemnenda gloria, sua nomina
inscribunt?” And this is intended to be
evidence for the corruption ⁴ in 115.1

Brutum] Callaicus or Callaecus, consul
in 13.c. 138, the conqueror of the warlike
Lusitani and Callaeci. Brutus carried the
Roman arms to the shores of the ocean, to
the north-western extremity of the Spanish
peninsula. He had to fight against both
men and women, for the women took up
arms in defence of their homes against the
invader. Brutus was a patron of the tragic
poet Attius, and both a soldier and a man
of letters (Cicero, Brutus, c. 28). Rome
had more men of letters among her gene-
rals than any modern nation has. Brutus
built public monuments with the spoils of
Spain. In the temple that he built to Mars
near the Circus Flaminius he placed a seated
colossal statue of Mars by Scopas (Pliny,
36, c. 5). But Brutus did not get that
from Spain. Perhaps some of his brother
plunderers in Greece gave it him.
