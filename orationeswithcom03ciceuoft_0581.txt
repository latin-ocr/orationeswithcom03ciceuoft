the true word, as it is here3 for the ‘dis-
criptio' is the determination of the parts
and divisions of a thing. In the De Re
Publica, i. 46 : “ sic adfirmo nullam omnium
rerum publicarum aut constitutione aut
discriptione aut disciplina conferendam
esse cum ea quam patres nostri nobis ac-
ceptam jam inde a majoribus reliquerunt ;'’
and ii. 22: “reliquum populum distribuit
in quinque classes . . . Quae discriptio si
esset ignota vobis explicaretur a me.'⁷

ab universo populo] The whole populus
elected the magistratus, and every Roman
citizen in Cicero’s time and long before was
eligible to any magistratus. Admission to
the Senate was got by being first elected to
a magistratus by the people, and t'cen for-
mally admitted into the Senate by the cen-
sors. After Sulla's time the quaestorship
gave a man admission to the Senate, as
Ferratius says. But before Sulla's time
those who had been quaestores were ‘lecti ’
by the censors (Liv. xxiii. 23). Cicero
(Verr. Act. i. c. 4) calls the ‘⁴ quaestura pri-
mus gradus honoris.’' Accordingly Cicero
could say (Verr. ii. 4. c. ll) that the sena—
tors owed their places to the popular elec-
tion, for it was only by virtue of their being
elected to a magistratus that they were qua-
litied to be placed on the list of senators by
the censors.

Cicero has well marked the character of
the Roman Senate. It was not a body con-
sisting of nobles who claimed a place by
hereditary title. but by merit, at least such
merit as is implied by the fact of popular
election. It was a body which always sub-
sisted (sempiternum), though it was always
changing, and every Roman might get a
place in it. Such it was in theory, but it
was not quite the same in practice, as Cicero
found. It was easier for a noble to get
elected to a high office than for an unknown
man. Like all such bodies, however con-
stituted, whether by hereditary succession
or in any other way, the Roman Senate
contained both good and bad men. It was
superior to a Senate where admission may
be got by birth alone, for any mode of ad-
mission which implies merit or the opinion
of merit is better than mere accident3 and
it was better constituted than a body which
is formed immediately by popular election,
and has a limited existence of one or seven

years; and better constituted in this re-
spect, that though a man was qualitied for
admission to the Roman Senate by having
held a magistratus by virtue of popular
electiori, he could only be admitted into
the Senate by the censors, and if they had
no objection to him3 and the censors could
turn him out too, if they thought proper3
better constituted in this too, that the rank
was for life. Such was the constitution of
the Roman Senate. Looking at it histo-
rically, we must admit that it was a wise
body, and that Rome owed to it her long
period of existence. If the Senate had
been elected directly by the people, and for
a limited time, the Roman state would nei-
ther have grown nor lived.

A body even thus constituted, which con-
sisted in a great part of men of old and
rich families, was essentially in opposition
to the people ; but it was this opposition of
Senate and people which made Rome great,
as Machiavelli proves. A body like the
Senate would become insolent and tyranni-
cal if it were not kept in check; and the
people, a nation in the mass, if their will or
their whim was always followed, would ruin
themselves before they knew it. Between
these two contending bodies, the nobles
who loved power and the people who hated
it, the Romans placed the Tribunate, the
guardians of liberty, often dishonest guar-
dians, but their occasional dishonesty did
not alter their office. It was in the nature
of things that the guardians of liberty were
sometimes corrupted by the nobles and
made common cause with them against
those whom it was their duty to protect.

The high offices of the Roman state came
naturally, as we say, for naturally here
means a just consequence of certain pre-
mises, into the hands of the great families,
and the rich. The men in power often
abused their power; and naturally. As
commanders of armies, administrators of
the state, and as governors of provinces,
they were guilty of great crimes and innu-
merable misdemeanours. But they were
always liable to prosecution3 not for trea-
son only. or directly attacking the Majestas
of the state, but for peculation, bad ma-
nagement, and other misdemeanours. Pro-
secutions at Rome were going on perpetu-
ally; and it is certain that in a large empire
with numerous branches of administration
and many foreign dependencies, prosecu-
