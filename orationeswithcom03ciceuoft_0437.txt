CAP. 54, 55. 423
Etenim, si nemo umquam praedo tam barbarus atque immanis fuit,
qui, quum fana spoliasset, deinde aram aliquam in littore deserto
somniis stimulatus aut religione aliqua consecraret, non horreret
animo, quum divinum ,numen scelere violatum placare precibus
cogeretur, qua tandem istum perturbatione mentis omnium
templorum atque tectorum totiusque urbis praedonem fuisse cen-
setis, quum pro detestatione tot scelerum unam aram nefarie con-
secraret? Non potuit ullo modo—quamquam et insolentia domi-
natus extulerat animos et erat incredibili armatus audacia—non in
agendo ruere ac saepe peccare, praesertim illo pontifice et magistro,
qui cogeretur docere antequam ipse didicisset. Magna vis est quum
in deorum immortalium numine, tum vero in ipsa re publica. Dii
immortales suorum templorum custodem ac praesidem sceleratis-
sime pulsum quum viderent, ex suis templis in ejus aedes immigrare

nolebant.
rebant.

ties for his crimes.’'
this beautiful contrast between a ‘praedo
barbarus’ and a ⁴ praedo urbis‚’ contains a
number of antitheses as usual. The most
striking is ‘some altar’ and the eonsecra-
tion under the ‘stimulant of dreams or some
religious fear3' and ‘one altar’ and the
consecration ‘nefarie.' We are also asked
to judge of the mental perturbation of the
man whom all the city saw and talked
about and carried the news to the Ponti-
fices, of the man whose perturbation was in
Rome, by comparing him with the pirate
on the desert shore, where nobody could
see him, none of Cicero's hearers at least
had seen him, whose horror was not felt
when he plundered the temples, but when
stimulated by dreams or some religion he
was compelled to appease the deities by
prayer. It is generally supposed that prayer
and sacrifice soothcd the mind. Here the
horror is only felt when the act of expiation
is doing3 and the Pontifices must measure
by the mental perturbation of the solitary
pirate the perturbatior] of the man whose
crime all Rome had seen.

cuslodem ac prae-sidem] He calls him-
self the ‘custos ac praeses ’ of the temples.
How could he do that? He could say that
he saved the city from conflagration at the
time of the conspiracy; but that did not
constitute him ‘custos ac praeses,⁷ as he
says that he was when he lest Rome. But
the end of the sentence as usual clears up
such difficulties. The gods would not go

Itaque istius vecordissimi mentem cura metuque ter-
Res vero publica, quamquam erat exterminata mecum,

from their temples to the house ofa man
who was the guardian of their temples and
was driven away. And for a good reason.
Who would take care of their temples when
they and their ‘ custos ' were gone? This is
the ‘ magna vis in deorum immortalium
numine ;⁷ just sense enough not to quit
their houses without leaving somebody to
take care of them. “ Accordingly (itaque)
they terrified the man.” This is one of the
Declamator’s ‘ itaques ;’ which mean as
much as his ‘paene ' (Quum Senatui, c. 15).
But all the immortal gods were not invited
to Cicero’s house. We have only heard of
Libertas, an inferior personage ; and she
accepted the invitation. Such puerile tri-
fling is disgusting: still more disgusting to
find men who explain and defend it. Cicero
often speaks of the immortal gods and says
many strange things about them; but as he
knew what words meant, he does not fall
into such intolerable absurdity. A man may
have to talk of ridiculous things, as Roman
superstition was, but a sensible man can talk
about them without making a fool of him-
self.

eoetermiuata] The old story again (c.
53). The reading ⁴ extinctoris,' P. G., has
been changed in some editions into ‘ extermi-
natoris‚’ for which Wolf says there is some
MSS. authority, and that the word would
agree better with ¹ exterminata? But that
is a reason why we should not prefer it, for
the writer never is consistent nor does he
keep to his metaphors.—⁴ indomito,' Halm,
Baiter. C. has ‘ inito.’ The common read.
