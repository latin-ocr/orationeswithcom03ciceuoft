promise them any thing, that they might be able to furnish complete
evidence against them. The treacherous Galli were the consuls’ ready
tools. They demanded, as they were prompted by Cicero, a written state-
ment from Lentulus, CetheguS, Statilius, and Cassius of their proposal, as
necessary to satisfy their people at home. All of them gave the writing
except Cassius, who promised that he would soon go to Gallia, and he
left Rome before the ambassadors. Lentulus appointed a man of Cro-
tona, one T. Volturcius, to accompany the ambassadors to the camp of
Catilina on their way home, that the alliance might be confirmed with
him. Lentulus also gave Volturcius a letter for Catilina (Sallust, Cat.
c. 44 3 Cic. In Cat. iii. 5).

The Allobroges left Rome on the night of the second of December.
Cicero, who was informed of every thing, gave orders to the Praetors
L. Valerius Flaccus and C. Pomptinus to take an armed force and lie in
wait for the Allobroges at the Pons Mulvius near Rome. The Allo-
broges, who were acquainted with the design, surrendered to the
Praetors3 and Volturcius, finding that he could make no resistance,
did the same. Cicero was immediately informed of the capture of the
Galli and the letters that they had from the conspirators. He had now
got the evidence that he wanted3 but he did not know what to do with
the conspirators whom he had detected. However he took his resolution.
He sent for LentuluS, Cethegus, Statilius, and Gabinius to his house3
and the men came immediately. One Caeparius of Terracina, who had
been commissioned to stir up the slaves in Apulia, was also summoned,
but he found out what the meaning of the summons waS, and made his
escape. The consul took the praetor Lentulus by the hand and led him
to the temple of Concordia, where the Senate was summoned to meet.
The rest were taken there under custody. The Senate was crowded.
Volturcius and the legati of the Allobroges were brought in3 and the
Praetor Flaccus was there with the letters which he had taken from the
legati (Sallust, Cat. c. 46). The conspirators were convicte-d by the
evidence of the Allobroges, their own handwriting, and even by their
own confession (Cicero, in Cat. iii. c. 4). It was resolved that the
conspirators, and also Caeparius, who had been taken, should be put in
custody “in liberis custodiis haberentur.'' (Sallust, Cat. c. 473 Cic. In
Cat. iii. (33 Plutarch, Cicero, c. 19).

“It was now ovoning‚ and the people in crowds were waiting about
the templo, when Cicero came forth and told the circumstances to the
citizens'' (Plutarch). This is the speech which we have under the
name of the Third Oration against Catilina. It changed the opinion of
those who wore in favour of revolution: they cursed Catilina, and
extolled Cicero to the skies. They thought that the usual events of
a civil war might bring them profit rather than loss; but the burning
