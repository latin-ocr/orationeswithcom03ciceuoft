immisisses, cujus cum patre, avo, majoribus societas nobis et
amicitia fuisset, hujus pecuniae deportandae, et, si quis suum
defenderet, bello gerendo M. Catonem praefecisti. Dices, quem
virum? Sanctissimum, prudentissimum, fortissimum, amicissimum
rei publicae, virtute, consilio, ratione vitae mirabili ad laudem et
prope singulari. Sed quid ad te, qui negas esse verum quemquam
ulli rei publicae extra ordinem praefici? IX. Atque in hoc solum
inconstantiam redarguo tuam, qui in ipso Catone, quem tu non pro
illius dignitate produxeras, sed pro tuo scelere subduxeras, quem
tuis Sergiis, Lolliis, Titiis ceterisque caedis et incendiorum ducibus
objeceras, quem carnificem civium, quem indemnatorum necis
principem, quem crudelitatis auctorem fuisse dixeras, ad hunc
honorem et imperium extra ordinem nominatim rogatione tua
detulisti et tanta fuisti intemperantia, ut illius tui sceleris rationem
occultare non posses. Litteras in contione recitasti, quas tibi a
C. Caesare missas diceres. CAESAR PULCHRO: quum etiam es
argumentatus amoris esse hoc signum, quod cognominibus tantum
uteretur neque ascriberet, PRo consum aut TRIBUNO PLEBI3
deinde gratulari tibi, quod [idem in posterum] M. Catonem a tri-
bunatu tuo removisses, et quod idem in posterum de extraordinariis
potestatibus libertatem ademisses3 quas aut numquam tibi ille
litteras misit, aut, si misit, in contione recitari noluit, aut, sive

be perhaps explained by the context. Klotz
thinks that the expression in the Pro Sestio
is a complete answer to Wolf’s objection.

siquis suum] ‘si jus suum,’ Halm, Baiter.

9. qui in ipso Catone‚] The sentence is
incomplete. Mommsen proposes ‘ quid in
ipso Catone ?’ which makes it easier. The
opposition of ‘produxeras ’ and ¹ sub-
duxeras ’ is in the author’s style. ⁴ Pro-
duxeras ⁹ is intelligible; but the other is
not. Manutius says of it: “ ne tibi ad-
versaretur in tuo tribunatu.” We learn
what is meant from the oration Pro Sestio,
c. 28: “non illi ornandum M. Catonem,
sed relegandum, nec illi committendum
illud negotium, sed imponendum putave-
runt.” He alludes to Cato as one of those
who voted for the punishment of the con-
spirators. The expression ‘indemnatorum
necis principem ¹ is at least not common, if
it is Latin. It is not like the other uses of
‘ princeps ’ with a genitive.

quod coqnominibus] This is Lambinus’
correction for the common reading ‘ quum
nominibus3’ and the MSS. show that he
was right. The omission of the ‘nomen'
in a letter was a mark of familiarity‚ as

we see from Cicero's letters. The infinitive
‘gratulari' is found fault with by Wolf.
Perhaps it depends on ‘diceres' Baiter
writes ⁴ et quod eidem . . . ademisses,’ the
conjecture of Ursini and Gulielmius. But
what is this ‘libertas’ which Clodius took
away? Markland commends Hotmann for
saying that he did not understand it, unless
the word ‘intercedendi ' is supplied or
added. Markland observes that this is an
imitation of the passage in the Pro Sestio,
c. 28: “qui in contione palam dixerint
linguam se evellisse M. Catoni, quae semper
contra extraordinarias potestates libera
fuisset.'’

Those may believe who choose that
Caesar wrote a letter from Gallia to his
dear Pulcher. The writer is willing to sup-
pose, and even contends that it was a fiction.
But we may go further and suppose that
the fiction of the letter is a fiction too.
Klotz says: “itis certain that Clodius did
every thing at Caesar's instigation, and cer-
tain that the letter was genuine which Clo-
dius communicated :’' as certain as the ge-
nuineness of this oration3 but not more
certain.—-‘aut‚ sive :’ ‘at, sive,’ Baiter.
