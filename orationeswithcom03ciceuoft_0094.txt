80 ORAT. IV. IN L. CATILINAM

ejus impuberem, legatum a patre missum, in carcere necatum esse
dixit. Quorum quod simile factum, quod initum delendae rei
publicae consilium? Largitionis voluntas tum in re publica versata
est et partium quaedam contentio. Atque illo tempore hujus avus
Lentuli, vir clarissimus, armatus Gracchum est persecutus: i e
etiam grave *tum vulnus accepit, ne quid de summa re publica
minueretur: l‘ji'c ad evertenda rei publicae fundamenta Gallos ar-
cessit, servitia concitat, Catilinam vocat, attribuit nos trucidandos
Cethego, ceteros cives interficiendos Gabinio, urbem inflammandam
Cassio, totam Italiam vastandam diripiendamque Catilinae. Vere-
amini, censeo, „ne in hoc scelere tam immani ac nefando nimis
aliquid severe statuisse videamini: multo magis est verendum
ne, remissione poenae crudeles in patriam quam ne severitate
animadversionis nimis vehementes in acerbissimos hostes fuisse
‚videamini

cruel to the younger son of Fulvius, who
had neither raised up his hand against them
nor been among the combatants3 for he was
seizcd before the battle, when he came to
treat of ternis. and was put to death after
the battle.'’ Cicero only mentions one son
here, and hc speaks ofthe son who was cruelly
murdered. In another oration (Phil. viii.
c. 4) he says, ‘⁴ P. Lentulum, principem
senatus, complures alios summos viros, qui
cum L. Opimio consule armati Gracchum
in Aventinum persecuti sunt, quo in praelio
Lentulus grave vulnus accepit, interfectus
est Gracchus et M. Fulvius consularis ejus-
que duo adolescentuli filii.'' Here two sons
are killed in fight, and Gracchus killed3 and
yet Gracchus killed himself. Again he
speaks in another place somewhat vaguely
of this affair (In Cat. i. 2). Halm has a
way of rcmoving the difficulty, which is
not to my taste, but Ι state it that others
may judge. Hc. is inclined to assume
that Caesar only said, “avum filiumque
jussu consulis intertbvtos csse‚'’ and that
Cicero confounded the elder son who fell
with his father in the right with the younger
son whose fate was better known.
LarysilioniS voluutas] The Gracchi had
no designs like Catilina and his men. They
merely wished to give the common folks
something at the expense of the state3 corn
for nothing or at a low price: aud land,
which they would have taken from the

possessors. Vol. II. In Rullum.

hujus avus Lentulzss] In Cat. iii. 5.—¹ mi-
nuereturz' ‘diminueretur,’ Halm.

Vereamini‚] ‘ Veremini,’ which is in
some editions, is a corruption introduced
by Ernesti.—‘ videamini ;’ there is better
authority for this than for the reading in
the common editions, ‘videamur.’ Halm
properly remarks that we should not take
offence at the repetition of the same termi-
nation‚ ⁶vereamini—videamini,’ which was
probably used purposely‚ as in this oration
and in this chapter, ‘dixit—dixit3' in iii.
c. 2, ⁸ provideretis—videretis ς’ and in many
other examples. For want of attending to
this the critics have taken in hand the
mending of many passages, which the au-
thors evidently intended to be as they are.

7. eoeaztdi‹›,] ⁴ Ι hear clearly,’ says Halm;
but the context shows that this is not the
meaning. He refers to the passage in the
oration Pro Sulla, c. 10, which also proves
his explanation to be wrong. There is a
passage quoted by Forccllini, which is vcry
clear (Cic. Ad Att. xiii. 48) τ “ Heri nescio
quid in strepitu videor exaudisse, quum
diceres te in Tusculanum venturum.” Com-
pare Livy, ii. 273 and Caesar, Β. G. vi. 39.
(Sec In Cat. i. c. 8, note.) There are other
passages from which the meaning of ⁴ exau-
dire’ appears: Caesar, B. G. v. 30; vii. 47;
and Cicero, De Legg. i. 7.
