298 INTRODUOTION.

statesman and a Roman to speak like one; and if he does not, we
suspect that somebody is using his name. Cicero certainly showed
little spirit in his exile, and in his letters he speaks only of himself. He
says nothing about the state, and there is no evidence in his letters that
he cared for it. He returned in ill humour, no doubt, but he could never
have made the first two of these speeches, if he had not entirely lost his
judgment, and almost his understanding.

The sixth thing to observe, says Wolf, is the peculiar style or
character of a writer3 for the style, as it has been said, is the man.
Every writer has a manner of his own, good or bad. It 15 so, as Wolf
observes, with other arts, music, painting, sculpture, for there never was
a great artist, who had not a peculiar style3 and so true is this that ,
the commonest observer knows the work of a great master as soon as he
sees it. In architecture, in sculpture, and we may assume in painting
too, the Greeks did what will never be done again. It is so with
writing. The Greek and Roman writers had a language which they
have used with an art that leaves all modern writers behind them3 and
I suppose it will not be affirmed that there is any thing in any
modern language which is equal to the best specimens of Cicero. A
man then whose judgment is formed by a good discipline and who has
a competent knowledge of the Latin language will know whether a
work which passes under Cicero’s name is his or not. It is not a ques-
tion for learned critics to decide who look at words more than thoughts:
it is a matter in which a sound judgment 15 necessary, and to all those
who have it, the question of the genuineness of these orations must be
1e.ferred It seems -plesumptuous for any man to declare himself against
the genuineness of certain speeches of Cicero which many good scholars
have read without suspicion and have even admired. But a man may
have learning, as it is called, without understanding, taste, 01· judgment,
of which there are many notorious exampleS. It is also notorious how
little profit many men get from the books of antiquity, and yet spend
their lives over them. They converse daily with the best men and
greatest men that have lived, and read their thoughts expressed in the
best language that man has yet found, and yet they are neither
wiser nor better than other people, and often neither so wise nor so

ood.
g I wished to omit these four tedious orations, but they are still con-

sidered genuine by many scholars, and in the last edition of Orelli they
are placed with the rest in the body of the orations and in the order of
time. I have therefore read them carefully and made such notes as
wcrc necessary for the double purpose of explaining them aud proving
them to be spurious; and many notes are necessary for this purpose.
No student should read these orations until he knows Cicero's orations
