382 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

nio Syria dabatur, Macedonia Pisoni, utrique infinitum imperium,
ingens pecunia, ut tibi omnia permitterent, te adjuvarent, tibi
manum, copias, tibi 51105 speratos centuriones, tibi pecuniam, tibi
familias compararent, te suis sceleratis contionibus sublevarent,
senatus auctoritatem irriderent, equitibus Romanis mortem pro-
scriptionemque minitarentur, me terrerent minis, mihi caedem et
dimicationem denuntiarent, meam domum refertam viris bonis
per amieos suos complerent, proscriptionis metu me frequentia
nudarent virorum bonorum, me praesidio spoliarent, senatum pro
me non modo pugnare, amplissimum ordinem, sed etiam plorare, et
supplicare mutata veste prohiberent, ne tum quidem vis erat? ’
XXII. Quid igitur ego cessi aut qui timor fuit ἓ 11011 dicam, in me
—fac me timidum esse natura—quid illa tot virorum fortissimorum
millia? quid nostri equites Romani? quid senatus? quid denique
onmes boni? Si nulla erat vis, eur me flentes potius prosecuti
sunt quam aut increpantes retinuerunt aut irati reliquerunt? An
hoc timebam, si mecum ageretur more institutoque majorum, ut
possem praesens sustinere? Utrum si dies dicta esset, judicium
mihi fuit pertimescendum, an sine judicio privilegium? J udicium
in caussa tam turpi? Scilicet homo, qui eam si jam esset ignota

he makes this silly remark: “All this
violence might have been easily overpowered
and crushed either by good men’s cou-
rage or number.'' If number alone was
enough, bad men would have done as well
as good. He then returns to his ἔ1115,’
and so drags on through another long
tedicus sentence. “ Bene sonat brevis pe-
riodus, longioribus duabus interjecta. Unum
deest: verba, ad sonum optima, nihil rei

serves that the matter is got from the ora-
tion In Pison. c. 5 : ‘⁴ Erat non solum domus
mea, sed totum Palatium, Senatu, equitibus
Romanis, civitate omni, Italia cuncta refer-
tum ;” and from the oration Pro Plancio, c.
35 :- “Aderat mecum‚’' &c.

22. cessi] The correction of Pantaga—
thus, confirmed by Codd. Lagom. tres.
The other MSS. have ‘gessi.’—‘ more in-
stitutoque? if he had been tried by the

continent, aut aliquid falsi. Ac 0110 ad vim
redibit, quae hic dicitur fracta et superata
esse '⁷ (Wolf).

speratos] There is no sense in ‘ speratos
centuriones‚⁷ ‘the centurions whom they
hoped for3’ for, as Graevius observes, the
consuls could not be said to lend Clodius
the centurions whom they hoped to have.
Lambinus wrote ‘sparatos' ‘armed with
spari,’ which is as ridiculous as if we were
to speak of a regular soldier armed with
a pitchfork. Graevius changed ‘ speratos ’

to ‘ paratos!
meam domum] Markland, who is fol-

lowed by Baiter, points thus, and alters
‘ Senatum ’ into ‘Senatusz’ ⁴⁴ complerent
proscriptionis metu, me frequentia . . .
spoliarent Senatus3 pro me non modo.'⁷
Perhaps this mends it a little3 but there
is no reason for mending. Markland ob-

‘ populus ' after the old fashion‚ or if some
bill of pains and penalties were carried
against him. The phrase ⁴ si dies dicta
esset ’ expresses the notice of trial.

Judiez'um . . . aplicare] I suppose he
is ironical : ⁴ Fear a trial in such a bad
case ?’ What follows seems corrupt. Gara-
toni would read ‘An is homo sum.' A ‘caussa
incognita ’ is a ⁴ caussa ' in which the ‘ patro-
nus ' has not been instructed by his clients or
which he has not studied (De Or. ii. 24):
“ Ita nonnulli caussas dicunt incognitas, in
quo est illa quidem magna offensio vel negli-
gentiae susceptis rebus, vel perfidiae receptis. '⁹
So a ⁴ caussa ignota' might be a ⁴ caussa'
that a man is not acquainted with. But he
means, I suppose, what Klotz says, that his
‘caussa ' was well known to all the Ro<
mans. And if it had not been, he could
easily have explained it.
