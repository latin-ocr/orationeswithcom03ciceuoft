ut qui modus moribus fuerat, idem esset injuriae.
extrudere ad Cypriam pecuniam. Praeda perierit; alia non
deerit3 hanc modo amandas esse. Sic M. Cato invisus quasi per
beneficium Cyprum relegatur. Ejiciuntur duo quos videre improbi
non poterant,1alter per honorem turpissimum, alter per honestis-
simam calamitatem. Atque ut sciatis non hominibus istum, sed
virtutibus hostem semper fuisse, me expuISO, Catone amandato, in
eum ipsum se convertit, quo auctore, quo adjutore in contionibus
ea quae gerebat omnia quaeque gesserat se et fecisse et facere dice-
bat: Cn. Pompeium, quem omnium judicio longe principem esse
civita-tis videbat, diutius furori suo veniam daturum non arbitrabatur.
Qui ex ejus custodia per insidias regis amici filium, hostem, capti-
vum, surripuisset, et ea injuria virum fortissimum lacessisset,
speravit iisdem se copiis cum illo posse confligere quibuscum ego
noluissem bonorum periculo dimicare, et primo quidem adjutoribus
consulibus: postea fregit foedus Gabinius3 Piso tamen in fide
mansit. Quas iste tum caedes, quas lapidationes, quas fugas
fecerit, quam facile ferro quotidianisque insidiis, quum jam a
firmissimo robore copiarum suarum relictus esset, Cn. Pompeium
foro curiaque privarit domumque conjecerit vidistis. Ex quo
judicare potestis quanta vis illa fuerit oriens et congregata, quum
haec Cn. Pompeium terruerit jam distracta et exstincta.

is no use in repeating all that has been pro-
posed for the cure of this corrupt passage.
The passage, as Hotmann gives it from a
‘ vetus liber,’ is somewhat more intelligible3
but Ι forbear to copy it out. It is printed
in some editions.

quo auctorem] Compare Pro Sestio, c.
17 : “ omnibus in contionibus illa furia cla-
mabat se quae faceret contra salutem meam
facere auctore Cn. Pompeio, clarissimo viro
mihique et nunc et quoad licuit amicis-
simo.’'

reyz‘s. . filium] Thc son ofTigranes whom
Pompeius brought to Rome after his wars
with Mithridates and Tigranes. ⁴⁴ For after
Clodius had ejected Cicero and sent off
Cato to Cyprus under colour of giving him
a command, and Caesar was gone to Gaul,
and Clodius saw that the people were de-
voted to him as he was doing every thing
and passing all his measures to please them,
he immediately attempted to repeal some of
the regulations of Pompeius, and seizing
the person of the captive Tigranes he kept
him in his own house, and he instituted
prosecutions against the friends of Pom-
peius, and so made trial of the power of

Pompeius by attacking his friends’⁷ (Plu-
tarch, Pompeius, e. 483 Dion Cassius, 38.
c. 303 and Asconius ad Milon. c. 14).
distracta et crslinela] Markland cannot
understand how a ‘vis exstincta ’ could have
terrified Pompeius: and he also ask-s how a
¹ vis ' could be ¹ exstincta‚’ which had first
become ⁴ distracta,' divided by Gabinius
passing over to the side of Pompeius. I
suppose there was first a ‘distractio ’ of the
‘ vis ’ made hy Gabinius going over to Pom-
peius, and this ‘vis’ was ‘exstincta' as a
‘ vis ⁷ opposed to Pompeius. But the other
half remained. But I do not think that. the
writer could have found out his own mean-
ing. He rather means that the ‘vis' was
‘distracta' and also ‘exstinctaz’ in other
words there was noneg and yet Pompeius
was alarmed by it. It is true that there
were terrible disturbances after Gabinius
left the party of Clodius3 there was murder
and stone-throwing ; and Clodius easily
(facile) kept Pompeius from the Forum and
Curia, and shut him up in his house. The
‘vis ' by which all this was done is called
‘distracta et exstincta.' But the writer's
purpose is not obscure. He was labouring
