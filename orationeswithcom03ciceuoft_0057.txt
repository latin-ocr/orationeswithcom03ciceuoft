OAP. 7, 8. 43

argentm tu familia, tu rebus omnibus ornatus et copiosus sis, et
dubites de possessione detrahere, acquirere ad fidem? Quid enim
exspectas? Bellum? Quid ergo in vastatione omnium tuas pos-
sessiones sacrosanctas futuras putas? An tabulas novas? Errant
qui istas a Catilina exspectant. Meo beneficio tabulae novae pro-
ferent-ur, verum auctionariae. Neque enim isti qui possessiones
liabent alia. ratione ulla salvi esse possunt. Quod si maturius
facere voluissent, nequeq id quod stultissimum est, certare cum
usuris fructibus praediorum, et locupletioribus his et melioribus
civibus uteremur. Sed hosce homines minime puto pertimescendos,
quod aut deduci de sententia possunt, aut, si permanebunt, magis

de possessione Μινώην-0,] Here and in
the expression ‘possessiones habent’ the
word means ‘ property 3' as in Horace’s
⁴ valeat possessor oportet ’ (Ep. i. 2. v. 49),
and many other instances. See the Index
to Vol. II. ‘ Detrahere ’ and ¹ adquirere '
are thus used absolutely sometimes. Cicero
says (Ad Att. xi. ll): ‘⁶ Ille in Achaia non
cessat de nobis detrahere.”

tabulae novae] These are ‘ new books‚’
new reckonings. Among the inducements
to revolution which Catilina (Sallust, Cat.
c. 21) offered to his associates was relies
from their debts and the possession of other
people's property. The Romans occasion-
ally settled the affairs of insolvents by a Lex,
of which the Lex Valeria is an example
(Vol. II. Pro M. Fonteio, c. l). They do
not appear to bave had at this time any
general way of settling the affairs of insol-
vents. If Catilina aud his friends had lived
in England‚ they would have passed through
the court. for insolvent debtors. The relief
given to debtors at Rome by ⁶ tabulae
novae ’ was at the expense of their creditors‚
whose claims were diminished by a third or
a fourth, or by some other amount, as the
case might be. Cicero promises relief to
debtms, but in another way. He will com-
pel them to settle their affairs by a sale of
part of their property3 and he says that it
was done. It is not easy to see why the
creditors themselves did not do it; or why
the debtors could not make them do it.
Cicero speaks of a general compulsory set-
tlement; one that was to be made whether
debtor or creditor liked it or not. The pas-
sage in the De Officiis (ii. 24), which has
often been referred to, explains this: ¹⁴ Ta-
bulae vero novae quid habent argumenti,
nisi ut 011135 mea pecunia fundum, eum tu
habeas, ego non habeam pecuniam? Quam-
obrem ne sit aes alienum quod rei publicae

noceat providendum est3 quod multis ra-
ti mibus caveri potest3 non, si fuerit, ut
locupletes 51111111 perdant, debitores lucrentur
alienum. Nec enim ulla res vehementius rem
publicam continet quam tides, quae nulla
esse potest, nisi erit necessaria solutio rerum
creditarum. Numquam vehementius actum
est quam me consule ne solveretur: armis
et castris tentata res est ab omni genere
hominum et ordine, quibus ita restiti ut hoc
tantum malum de re publica tolleretur.
Numquam nec majus aes alienum fuit nec
melius nec facilius dissolutum est, fraudandi
enim spe sublata, solvendi necessitas con—
secuta est.''

Cicero speaks of men's lands being en-
cumbered b'y debt, by the payment of
interest, and of the produce of the lands
(fructus) being insufficient to pay the inter-
est of the money (usurae). This might
arise either from land having been bought
with borrowed money, which generally
ends in the ruin of the borrower. or money
having been borrowed on the hypothecation
of land. Cicero 1135 expressed in a few
words 3 condition which is attached to the
ownership of 131111, when the owner has
mortgaged it; a struggle between the interest
and the proceeds of the land. The best
way of ending it is to sell the land, or
enough of it to clear off the debt, 3311 rest
in peace from the urgent demands of the
money-lender. He who holds the previous
metal, or who has the right to demand it, is
the greedy 111311, 1110 avaricious man. He
who holds the 131111 may be profuse and
generous. But whatever he may he, the
owner of the land wagcs 311 unequal contest
with the man to whom it has hevu mort-
gaged. The produce of the land and the
value of it are uncertain. The interest on
the borrowed mone)- is tixed aud must be
paid at fixed times.
