ters3 which could only be the case where
the woman had come ‘in manum viri?
“Similiter non admittuntur cognati, qui
per feminini sexus personas necessitudine
junguntur, adeo quidem ut nec inter ma-
trem et filium filiamve ultro citroque here-
ditatis capiendae jus competat, praeterquam
si per in manum conventionem consangui-
nitatis jura inter eos constiterint ⁷¹ (Gaius,
iii. 24 .

If t)hen Cicero tells the truth when he
says that if a woman was in ‘tutela legi-
tima,’ she could not come ‘ in manum viri ‘
by ‘usus’ without the consent of all the
Tutores, and if this consent had not been
given, the husband had no title to the wife's
succession. Cicero says the same of ‘co-
emptio ' and the consent of the Tutores;
and if he tells the truth, the legal conse-
quence is the same as in the ‘ conventio in
manum ' by ⁴ usus.'. The husband in nei-
ther case had any claim.

Klotz has a long note on this passage in
which he mistakes the main matter. He
supposes that Andro claimed 1115 wife’s pro-
perty as her ‘suus heres,⁷ when he ought to
have known that a woman could have no
‘suus heres.' Andro claimed as her hus-
band, but as husband he could have no
claim to the property of 1115 wife, except by
the ‘conventio in manum' or ‘dotis no-
mine.y Rein has the same blunder 35 Klotz
(Das Romische Privatrecht, p. 180). So
gross a mistake seems almost incredible,
and Cicero himself might have warned
them against it, for he speaks herc of the
husband's title to the wife's, property being
by marriage ⁴ cum conventione in manum,'

and in no other way. If the woman was not
in ‘ manu viri,' her succession, according to
the old law, if she died intestate, came to
the ‘agnati.' It was just the same thing
as if she was not married at all (Gaius, iii.
14). Her husband had her merely ‘pro-
creandorum liberorum caussa! Cicero says
nothing about there being children; for it
was immaterial whether there were children
or not. They could not take as children.
For according to the Twelve Tables the
succession of an intestato mother, says Ul-
pian (Frag. xxvi. 7), did not come to their
children, because a woman cannot have
⁴ sui heredes.' It is a great absurdity then
to suppose that a ‘husband' could be a
wife’s ‘suus heres‚' when the foundation of
the right of succession is ‘cognatim' ‘ kin-
ship,' ‘blood relationship 3¹ and blood rela-
tionship through a male (agnatio). In the
time of M. Aurelius and his son Commo-
dus, a S. C. was passed to this effect, ‘⁴ ut
sine in manum conventione matrum legi-
timae hereditates ad filios pertineant exclu-
sis consanguineis et reliquis agnatis.'' lfa
son died intestate the law of the ΧΠ did
not allow the succession to go to the mother3
and the reason is plain. She was no ‘suus
heres.’ The S. C. Tertullianum gave the
succession, if the woman had the ‘jus libe-
rorum.’

L. Luculle] He was 3 judex on this
trial. Pighius, quoted by Klotz, supposes
that T. Vettius was praetor and presided at
this trial, and that he was 10 go to Africa
next year 35 propraetor; aud this is, l
think, a true explanation.
