232 INTRODUOTION TO THE

grounds for defending Flaccus, and he was assisted by Q. Hortensius,
who in his speech exalted the services of Cicero3 from which we see
that the defence of Flaccus as well as the prosecution was a party affair
(“ tuus familiaris Hortalus, quam plena manu, quam ingenue, quam
ornate nostras laudes in astra sustulit quum de Flacci praetura, et de
illo tempore Allobrogum diceret :” Cicero Ad Atticum, ii. 25). Flaccus
was acquitted.

The first part of the speech is defective 111 the MSS. Macrobius
(Sat. ii. c. 1) speaks of a certain joke of Cicero by which he saved
Flaccus, not being extant in the oration3 but this does not prove that
Macrobius had a copy of the speech as imperfect as ours, or imperfect
at all; for the joke may have been omitted by Cicero himself when he
published the oration. The deficiencies of this oration have been partly
supplied by the discoveries of A. Mai 111 the Ambrosian and Vatican
Libraries.

This oration shows that these trials at Rome must have cost very
large sums of money. A journey was made to Asia by the prosecutor
to collect evidence, and both written documents and witnesses were
brought from Asia to Rome. The expenses of the witnesses were paid‚
sometimes perhaps by their own town3 and sometimes as it appears by
the Roman aerarium. The defendant too brought witnesses from Asia,
Greece, and Massilia, to speak to his character, and somebody must
have paid their expenses.

The guilt of Flaccus is assumed by many critics. It may be so3 but
sor us it is immaterial whether he was guilty or not. It is more im-
portant to see how Cicero defended him. If we knew all the‘proceedings
on this trial, we might form a better judgment of the defendant’s guilt
and of the orator’s merits as an advocate. Hortensius spoke before
Cicero, who would not repeat much that Hortensius had said3 or he
would put it in a different form. We have not the evidence on the
trial, and our judgment on the speech of Cicero must be imperfect
without it.

The charges against Flaccus were the usual charges against Roman
governors3 oppression of the provincials generally, and particular acts
of violence and fraud, for the purpose of putting money in his pocket.
If there was no charge of getting money by illegal means against a.
governor, hc might do a grcat deal that was very bad without having
any fcar of being punished for it.

There was a great dcal of evidence against Flaccus, and Cicero lays the
foundation of his defcnce in a gcncral affirmation that the Greeks were
liars and could not bc believed. Indccd hc meets most of tho evidence,
so far as he tells us what it was, by an attempt to show that neither the
documents produced nor the witnesses were worthy of credit. And if
