OAP. 8, 9. 65
Illud vero nonne ita praesens est ut nutu Jovis Optimi Maximi
factum esse videatur, ut quum hodierno die mane per forum meo
jussu et conjurati et eorum indices in aedem Concordiae duceren-
tur, eo ipso tempore signum statueretur? quo collocato atque ad
vos senatumque converso, onmia et senatus et vos quac erant contra
salutem omnium cogitata illustrata et patefacta vidistis. Quo etiam
majore sunt isti odio supplicioque digni, qui non solum vestris
domiciliis atque tectis, sed etiam deorum templis atque delubris
sunt funestos ac nefarios ignes inferre conat-i. Quibus ego si me
restitisse dicam, nimium mihi sumam et non sim ferendus. Ille,
ille J uppiter restitit: ille Capitolium, ille haec templa, ille hanc
urbem, ille vos omnes salvos esse voluit. Diis ego immortalibus
ducibus hanc mentem, Quirites, voluntatemque suscepi atque ad haec

tanta indicia perveni.

Illud vero] Quintilian (Inst. v. ll. §42)
alludes to this passage, “ 111 contione contra
Catilinam, quum signum Jovis columnae
impositum ostendit.”—‘ praesens ε’ it is not
easy to find a word to express exactly this
sense of ‘praesens' Cicero is speaking of
the coincidence which he is going to men-
tion. Halm thinks that the notion comes
nearer to ‘divinum ' than to ‘ conspicuum,’
¹ manifestum‚' as Ernesti supposed3 and ac-
cordingly Cicero says, “ Is not the visible
interposition of the heavenly power manifest
in this? ’' On the words ⁴ ut quuin,' Halm
says that ‘ ut ’ depends on ‘illud‚' and ‘ ut
quum ’ is said short for ‘illud quod factum
est.' He compares another example (Vol. I.
Verr. v. c. 6) : “ Hoc vero novum et ejus-
modi est ut magis propter reum quam
propter rem ipsam credibile videatur, ut
homines servos —dimiserit.” The two pas-
sages are the same, but the explanation
seems to me incorrect. In the passage in
this oration ‘ ut quum—statueretur’ depends
on ‘factum esse videatur,’ and it also refers
to ‘ Illud' at the beginning of the sen·
tenca—‘et senatus et vos:’ om. Halm.—
‘ hanc urbem ι’ ‘cunctam urbem,' Halm. -
⁴ Diis ego—ducibus :' comp. Pro Sulla, c. 14.

Jam vero—ereptum] I have followed
Halm in Orelli’s ed. in this sentence, which
in the common texts is confused and unin-
telligible. The gods deprived the conspira-
fors of prudcuce, but permitted their auda-
cious designs; and so they led them to
their ruin. It would have been just as easy
and much better to have prevented their
designs. But Cicero expresses an idea,
which is often found in ancient writers, that
the gods will some men's ruin, and take the

voL. 111.

J am vero illa Allobrogum sollicitatio * ³¹⁶ *‚

means of accomplishing it. So says Euri-
pides 111 a fragment quoted by Halm:

‘'Orav γὰρ ὀργὴ δαιμόνων βλάπτῃ τινὰ,
Τοῦτ’ αὐτὸ πρῶτον έὲιιφαιρεῖναι φρενῶν
Τὸν νοῦν τὸν ἐσθλόν, ἐς δὲ τὴν χείρω
Γ Τρεπει (Ι Y ' Q F! Τ Ι Ι
νωμην, ιν ειόῃ μησεν ων αμαρτανει.

This passage goes further than Cicero’s,
which merely represents the gods as de-
priving villains of all prudence; which may
be interpreted to mean that a villain often
fails in his design, because his prudence is
not equal to his wickedness. But Euri-
pides represents the daemon as first hating
a man, then taking from him all under-
standing. and lastly turning his mind to the
worse judgment, so that he knows not when
he is doing wrong. This is a complete de-
scription of perfect malignity, of a daemon
who thinks of nothing but mischief.—‘ex
civitate male pacata:' the Allobroges, who
had often fought with the Romans, but
were now reduced to submission. (See Vol.
ΙΙ. Pro Fonteio, c. 12, and c. 16.) The
Allobroges rose again in 13.c. 61, and were
put down by C. Pomptinus, the man whom
Cicero mentions (c. 23 and in the oration
De Provinciis consularibus, c. 13). The
Romans knew little of the nations of Gallia
beyond the limits of the Provincia, and only
those who bordered on the Provincia, such
as the Aedui, Sequani, and Arverni. But
they knew that the Galli wei-c the most
formidable enemies that the Romans had
ever encountered‚ both the Galli of North
Italy and the Galli who had often crossed
the Alps to fight with the armies of Rome.
