574 ORAT. PRO Ρ. SESTIO

dibus; cui superior annus idem et virilem patris et praetextam
populi judicio togam dederit, hunc hoc anno in hac toga rogationis
injustissimae subitam acerbitatem pro patre fortissimo et clarissimo
cive deprecantem. Atque hic tot et talium civium squalor, hic
luctus, hae sordes susceptae sunt- propter unum me, quia me defen-
derunt, quia meum casum luctumque doluerunt, quia me lugenti
patriae, flagitanti senatui, poscenti Italiae, vobis omnibus orantibus
reddiderunt. Quod tantum est in me scelus? quid tanto opere
deliqui illo die, quum ad vos indicia, litteras, confessiones com-
munis exitii detuli, quum parui vobis? Ac si scelestum est amare
patriam, pertuli poenarum satis : eversa domus est, fortunae vexatae,
dissipati liberi, raptata conjux, frater optimus, incredibili pietate,
amore inaudito, maximo in squalore volutatus est ad pedes inimi-
cissimorum: ego pulsus aris, focis, dis penatibus, distractus a meis,
carui patria, quam, ut levissime dicam, certe texeram : pertuli cru-
delitatem inimicorum, scelus infidelium, fraudem invidorum. Si
1100 11011 est satis, quod hacc omnia deleta videntur reditu mco,

et virilem patr-is e! praetextam populi
judicio] ¹¹ Eodem anno quo togam virilem a
patre sumpsit, etiam auguratus praetextam
judicio populi adeptus est '’ (Schol.). He
was elected a member of the college of
augurs in the consulship of his father (Dion
39. 0. 17), though he was only a youth in
his seventeenth year; as babics and boys 111
modern times are sometimes put in great
places, or receive great names.

Meyer (Brutus, c. l) has a note on the
election of augurs. Originally the mem-
bers filled up the vacancies in their own
body, but in Cicero's time a new member
was nominated by two ‘collegae,' and his
nomination was confirmed by the people.
As to the age of assuming the ‘toga virilis‚’

royalionis injustissimae] He alludes, as
the Scholiast tells us——the defective parts of
the note are supplied by Mai—to the tri-
bunitian Rogatio against P. Lentulus.
The Egyptian king Ptolemy having been
expelled from his throne, and the Roman
Senate having consented to restore him, the
business was intrusted to P. Lentulus.
The Xviri having looked in the Sibylline
books discovered that the king ought not to
be restored with the aid of a force, nor yet
ought the Romans to refuse to restore him.
On this it was declared by a sctum that it
was dangerous to restore the king by force.
But on the business being intrusted to Len-
tulus, Cato tr. p1.‚ who was Lentulus’
enemy, carried a Rogatio by which Len-

tulus, who was then governor of Cilicia,
was deprived of his ‘imperium,' in order
that he might not be able to restore the
king-Cato is C. Cato. The affair is men-
tioned by Cicero. Ad Fam. i. 5. and Ad
Q. Fr. ii. 3, where he sayS, ‘⁴ C. Cato
legem promulgavit de imperio Lentulo
abrogando. Vestitum filius mutavit.’' The
historiari Fenestella had a passage on this
matter (Annal. xxii.): “ Itaque ut magis-
tratum tribuni inierunt, C. Cato turbulentus
adolescens et audax, nec imparatus ad
dicendum, initionibus (contionibus ?) assiduis
invidiam et Ptolemaeo, qui jam profectus ex
urbe erat, et P. Lentulo consuli parantijam
iter, concitare secundo quidem populi ru·
more coepit’' (Sallust, ed. Frotscher).

Dec. (Introduction to the orations against
Catilina, p. 10). When he says ‘parui
vobisss he addresses the senators chiefly
among the judices (Halm) 3 for Cicero only
followed the order of the Senate in execut-
ing the conspirators.

dissipati] His son Marcus separated
from 1115 daughter Tullia(Orelli).—‘raptata τ’
compare De Domo, 0. 23.

certe teoeeramq The reading of the
‘Codd. dett! (Halm). The expression
seems strange. P. has “ certatleielltexeram
sed ie expunctum3 certo detexeram G.”
(Halm). It is probable that there is some
corruption in the text. Various emenda-
tions have been proposed.
