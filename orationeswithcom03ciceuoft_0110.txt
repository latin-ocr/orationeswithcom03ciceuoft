96 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

nenda, magnis meis laboribus et periculis sustentata? Quod si in
iis rebus repetendis quae mancipi sunt, is periculum judicii prae-
stare debet qui se nexu obligavit, profecto etiam rectius in judicio
consulis designati is potissimum, consul qui consulem declaravit,
auctor beneficii populi Romani defensorque periculi esse debebit.
Ac si, ut nonnullis in civitatibus fieri solet, patronus huic caussae
publice constitueretur, is potissime honore affecto defensor daretur,
qui eodem honore praeditus non minus afferret ad dicendum aucto-
ritatis quam facultatis. Quod si [e] portu solventibus ii qui jam in
portum ex alto invehuntur praecipere summo studio solent et tem-
pestatum rationem et praedonum et locorum, quod natura fert ut
eis faveamus qui eadem pericula quibus nos perfuncti sumus ingre-

nius being out of Rome at the. head of
the army which followed Catilina. But
even if Antonius was at Rome during the
election, one consul could preside at the
Comitia, which indeed was the usual prac-
tice, and it is likely enough that the consul
who had been first returned at his own
election would preside at the election of the
next consuls. There is nothing then either
arrogant or inconsistent in Cicero saying
that the ‘ state is transferred by him alone‚’
no more than in saying that it is transferred
to Murena3 for as there was another con-
sul in office besides Cicero, so there was
another consul besides Murena to whom
the care of the state was transferred by the
new Comitia. I see then no objection to
‘uno.’ Klotz proposes ‘jam ;’ and Halm
‘ cuncta‚' but still he keeps ‘ una.’

in iis rebus repetendis] The ¹ res man-
cipi' are those things of which the owner-
ship is transferred by MancipatiO, which is
the same as ⁴ traditio alteri nexu ' (Cic.
Top. c. 5). The seller is answerable to the
buyer, if the buyer is evicted from what he
has bought by a man who has a better title
than himself. If the buyer was sued by a
man who claimed what he had bought, the
seller must stand the risk of the trial. ‘ Pe-
riculum praestare ⁷ with a genitive is a legal
expression (Dig. 27. 7. 3⁴), Excerpt from
Papinian). Cicero calls himself the ⁶ auctor
beneficii populi Romani ;' and 119. compares
himself to a seller of a thing who under-
takes to make it good to the buyer 111 case
of eviction. The 591191· 15 the ‘ auetor’
(Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 5. 9. 22).

consul qui com-ulem] Madvig, says
Halm, saw that ‘ consul ’ ought to bc erased3
and for this reason: “When we say ‘is
potissimum consul,’ we do 1101 mean that
the consul ought to defend before all others,
but that this consul (hunc consulem) rather

than the other, which is most absurd3 for
it is not the question, whether this consul,
but whether a consul should defend a man
who is guilty of bribery.” Accordingly
Halm has put ‘ consul’ in brackets. Mad-
vig has simply mistaken the meaning of
Cicero, who does not say ⁴ 1119 consul.’ He
says: ⁴⁴ In truth with more reason in the
trial of a consul designatus, he of all others,
a consul, who declared the man to be con-
sul, will be under an obligation to make
himself the guarantee of the honour that
the Roman people have conferred and the
man to repel the danger.’'

nonnullis in civitatibus] In some states
persons were appointed to act for the state
(publice) in prosecutions and in defences.
Moebius refers to Wolff's Prolegomena to
the. Leptines (p. 136): “Creabantur vero
Syndici vel publice vel privatim: publice
per χειροτονίαν, 11011 propter leges tantum,
sed ad defendendam domi aut foris quam-
cunque partem rei publicae in caussis civi-
tatem universam spectantibus.'’

polissime] This or ‘potissimo’ is the
MSS. reading, out of which Madvig has
made ⁴ potissimum summo‚' from the coali-
tion of which he supposes that the MSS.
reading has come. But he has not per-
ceived, I suppose, that Cicero would not
limit his argument to a case of ‘summus
honos.' Halm follows Madvig.

e portu] The preposition is not in the
MSS. of Cicero, but it is in some MSS. of
Quintilian, who quotes this passage (Inst.
v. ll. 23). Some MSS. of Quintilian have
also ‘praedicere' in place of ‘praecipere’
Halm has followed Quintilian in both cases.
⁴ Praedicere‚⁷ says Wesenberg, is most ap-
propriate here3 he doubts if ‘praecipere’
will do in this passage. The reading ⁴ prae-
dicere,' says Moebius, is hardly worth men—
tion. So they differ.
