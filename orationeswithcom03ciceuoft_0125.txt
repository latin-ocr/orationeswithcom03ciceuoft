XII. Quum hoc fieri bellissime posset: Fundus Sabinus meus

est : immo meus :

deinde judicium3 noluerunt.
Qut Es'r IN AGRO, QUI SAman VOCATUR.

FUNDUS, inquit,
Satis verbose. Cedo,

quid postea? EUM EGO Ex JURE QUIRITIUM MEUM ESSE Aio.

12. Cicero is ridiculing the forms of legal
procedure. He supposes the dispute to be
about the ownership of a piece of land ; and
that the matter might be stated in few
words: ⁴ The fundus Sabinus is mine,' says
the plaintiff: ‘ No, it is mine,’ says the de-
fendant3 then the trial. Though it might
have been done very conveniently in this
way, the lawyers would not have it so. The
plaintiff makes his claim in formal words,
‘Fundus qui3' ‘Eum ego 3’ ‘Inde ibi!
The defendant (ille unde petebatur) knew
not what to say to a suitor who used so
many words, but the lawyer helped him.
The lawyer was the master of the ceremo-
nies. The man who had dictated to the
plaintiff the formal words which he must
utter in order to comment-e the suit, now
steps over to the defendant and tells him
what his answer must be. He changes
place; he passes over to the other side like
a Latin flute-player. The ‘tibicen’ was
used on the stage, and he would play first
for one speaker and then for another. He
is called Latin, it is supposed, because it
was not an employment for a Roman citi-
zen (See Vol. 11. De Leg. Agr. ii. 34, note
on ‘ tibicines ’). Quintilian (vii. l, 51) says ε
“ Transeat nunc idem ille qui cogitavit, ut ait
Cicero, tibicinis Latini modo ad disertum.’'
The praetor too was not allowed to be idle;
he was not to think himself so lucky as to
escape. He had his form of words pre-
scribed by the master of the ceremonies
(sapiens ille) the formalist lawyer.

The ridicule of the Roman procedure
will be made intelligible by two extracts.
The first is from Gellius (xx. 10, Quid voca-
bulum, Ex jure manum consertum, signi-
ficet). The passage is long, but it is useful,
and every student will not have it by him,
nor understand it. “ Illamzm conserere est,
de qua re disceptatur, in re praesenti, sive
aqer, sive quid aliud est, cum adversario
simul manu prendere, et in ea re omnibus
verbis vindicare. Vindicia, id est, correptio
manus in re atque in loco praesenti apud
Praetorem ex duodecim Tabulis fiebat, in
quibus ita scriptum est: st QV1 lx [ηιμ]
MANVM coxsnnvxr. Sed postquam Prae-
tores propagatis Italiae finibus, datis juris·
dictionibus, negotiis occupati, proficisci vin-
diciarum dicendarum caussa in longinquas
res gravabantur, institutum est contra Duo-

decim tabulas tacito consensu, ut litigantes
non in jure apud Praetorem manum conse-
rerent, sed ex jure manum consertum voca-
rent; id est, alter alterum ex jure ad con-
serendam manum in rem de qua ageretur
vocaret, atque profecti simul in agrum de
quo uagabatur, terrae aliquid ex e0, uti
unam glebam, in jus in urbem ad Praetorem
deferrent, et in ea gleba tamquam in toto
agro vindicarent.”

The following is Savigny’s exposition of
Gellius (Vermischte Schriften, i. 294):
Bith parties were required in the presence
of the praetor to make the show of a cor-
poreal struggle about the thing that was
claimed. If the thing was a moveable, it
was brought before the praetor3 if it was a
piece of land, the praetor went with the par-
ties to the land. This was according to the
rule of the Twelve Tables. But when the
praetor's jurisdiction was enlarged, this form
of procedure was altered with respect to
land, and the parties went from the prae-
tor's court alone, without the praetor, to
the land, brought back a clod from it into
the presence of the praetor, and upon this
clod acted the symbolical contest. Festus
agrees with this (Festus, v. Vindiciae):
“ Vindiciae olim dicebantur illae (glebae ?)
quae ex fundo sumtae in jus allatae erant.'’
Cicero’s statement is somewhat different.
He says that the parties come before the
praetor, go away together, but return im-
mediately; all this being done with the
accompaniment of certain formal words,
partly uttered by the parties and partly by
the praetor, so that their going and return-
ing is no reality, but a mere form.

The only genuine technical expression
for this symbolical contest is‘ manum con-
serere3 'and this word is used two way:s

‘m jure manum conserere, 'when the thing
itself, or the representative clod, is brought
before the praetor-3 and‘ ex jure manum
consertum vocares when one party chal-
lenges the other before the praetor to go to
the land. Both expressions occur in Gel-
lius, the first from the Twelve Tables, the
second only is in Cicero and in Valerius
Probus.

savigny afterwards attempts to reconcile
the statements of Gellius and Cicero3 but
this is not material here—The MSS. of
Cicero have ¹ manu consertum?
