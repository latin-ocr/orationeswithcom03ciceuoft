petition in his purchase:’' a right Roman answer, and well worthy of
Cicero and his times.

Torquatus had attacked Cicero for undertaking the defence of Sulla,
and had used very hard language against him, though they had long
been on ternis of the greatest intimacy. He maintained that the man
who had discovered a conspiracy ought not to have undertaken the
defence of a man who was implicated in it. Cicero's first object was to
remove any prejudiee that Torquatus might have raised against him
personally, and also as the advocate of Sulla3 and this gave him the
opportunity, which he never neglected, of saying a great deal about
himself (c. 1—12). This was also a part of the defence, as he himself
says (c. 1), for if he could convince the Judices that he was doing right
in defending Sulla, he might expect that they would be the more dis-
posed to believe the innocence of his client. The second part of his
defence is directed to the refutation of the particular charges (013—24),
and to showing that the previous life of Sulla furnished no reason for
supposing that he was likely to be a conspirator against his country.
This part of the defence, the establishing of the good character of the
accused, comes last, though it was usually placed first, as Cicero says
(c. 24, at the end) ; and we must suppose that he had some good reason
for not following the usual practice. Sulla seems to have had sense or
cunning enough to keep quiet after his conviction for bribery3 and if
116 wished success to the conspiracy, he was too prudent to be active in
it. Accordingly the orator has a fine opportunity of contrasting his
conduct with the violence of Catilina, Lentulus, and Autronius. He
concludes (e. 30) with repeating what he had said before (c. 5), that
during his consulship he found 110 evidence of Sulla being a conspirator,
nothing to raise even a suspicion against him. He says that he would
not have defended Sulla, if he had believed that he was a conspirator.
He affirms that he did not believe him to be a conspirator, that he
found 110 evidence of any kind against him. We must then either
assume that Sulla was innocent, or that Cicero was dishonest3 for we
cannot allow a man to 116 for his client, to affirm that he is innocent
when he knows or believes him to be guilty. The utmost limit, in a
criminal matter, is that the orator shall make the best of his client’s
case, without making himself a witness for him.

Sulla was not grateful to the orator3 for we may infer that he sided
with Clodius, when this turbulent fellow attacked Cicero, and set his
brother Quintus' house on fire (Ad Att. iv. 3). Wthn the civil war
111-0116 out, Sulla, who liked to be 011 the winning side, joined Caesar, and
he commanded the right wing of Caesar's army 111 the battle of Phar-
salia (Bell. Civ. iii. 89). XVhen the property of the proscribed partizans
of Pompeius was put up to sale, Sulla returned to his old tricks, and
