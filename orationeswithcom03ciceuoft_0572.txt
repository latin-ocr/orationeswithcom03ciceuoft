558 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

majorum denique suorum omnium, sed Graeculorum instituto con-
tionem interrogare solebat, “Velletne me redire,” et, quum erat
reclamatum semivivis mercenariorum vocibus, populum Romanum
negare dicebat; is, quum quotidie gladiatores spectaret, numquam
est conspectus quum veniret. Emergebat subito, quum sub
tabulas subrepserat, ut “Mater te appello '³ dicturus videretur.
Itaque illa via latebrosior, qua spectatum ille veniebat, Appia jain
vocabatur. Qui tamen quoquo tempore conspectus erat, non modo
gladiatoreS, sed equi ipsi gladiatorum repentinis sibilis extimesce-
bant. Videtisne igitur quantum inter populum Romanum et con-
tionem intersit; dominos contionum omni odio populi notari3 qui-
bus autem consistere in operarum contionibus non liceat, eos omni
populi Romani significatione decorari?

Tu mihi etiam M. Atilium Regulum commemoras, qui redire
ipse Karthaginem sua voluntate ad supplicium quam sine iis cap-
tivis, a quibus ad senatum missus erat, Romae manere maluerit, et
mihi negas optandum reditum fuisse per familias comparatas et
homines armatos ἵ LX. Vim scilicet ego desideravi, qui, dum vis

fuit, nihil egi, et quem, si vis non fuisset, nulla res labefactare

Ludi, c. 54; but Cicero says of this man
whoever he was, ‘⁶ is quum quotidie gladia-
tores spectaret.’' But there is no weight in

his ancestor Claudius Caecus. The joke is
Cicero's own I think, as Halm suggests.
Opinions may differ about its egregiousness.

this remark. Who supposes that Clodius
never presented himself at Ludi but once
in his life3 aud that this man, though he
was a spectator, was not seen athis coming?
(numquam est conspectus quum veniret.)
Garatoni has some other reasons, not very
weighty, I think, though Halm has a dif-
ferent opinion.

Emerqebat subita] Theman had got under
the planks, the place from which the ghosts
come up, and he emerged from this hole as
if he were the ghost in the play of Ilione,
which eries out ‘ Mater te appello! ‘⁴ They
are the words of Deiphilus, who had been
killed hy his father Polymestor, and re-
turning srom the regions below addresses
his mother Ilione in the play of Pacuvius,
Heindorf, Hor. Serm. ii. 3. ν, 60 '’ (Mat-
thiae). The Scholiast on Cicero and Por-
phyrion on Horace speak of the shade of
Polydorus and not of Deiphilus. The play
was probably a favourite at Rome (see
Macleane’s Hor. note on Sat. ii. 3. v. 60).

latebrosior,] A, ‘latebrosa' P. G. This,
says Matthiae, is an ⁴ egregia dilogia,' the
comparison between the stealthy way in
which Appius Claudius got to see the ex-
hibition and the Appia via constructed by

eqni ipsi] Of the ‘essedarii’ and ‘andaba-
tae’ (Abrami). The hisses frightenedtbevery
horses. Halm cannot refrain from copying
Osiander’s version of this passage, ‘oblec-
tationis causa.’ However Ι can. We have
had enough of this kind of oblectation.

Tu mihi] The usual juxtaposition in
Cicero when two persons are put face to
face. The story about Regulus is told here
in the same way as in Horace, Carm. iii. 53
the other story is that he was sent to Rome
about the ransom of the Carthagini-an cap-
tives. The prosecutor is said to have con-
trasted Regulus with Cicero, Regulus who
would not stay in Rome, while his fellow-
captives were in the hands of the enemy,
and Cicero who rather than stay in exile,
effected his return hy violence and the aid
of armed men.

60. nihil φὴ] For I left my country to
avoid using force against force (Manutius).
—‘ senatus publice . . . gratias egit? see
Pro Plano. c. 32 (Halm). j‘qui provincias
cum imperio :’ proconsuls and propraetors,
as Manutius observes, for ‘quaestores ⁷ and
‘legati' had not that which the Romans
called ⁴ imperium.’
