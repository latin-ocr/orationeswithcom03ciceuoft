INTRODUCTION

To THE

ORATION FOR A. LICINIUS ARCHIAS,

THE POET.

A. Lim-ms ARomAs was a native of Antiochia in Syria. We know
little about him except what Cicero has told us in this oration. He
distinguished himself by his talents in his native city (c. 3), which lie
left when he was a very young man to travel in other parts of Asia and
in Greece. Cicero speaks in the most extravagant terms of his reputa-
tion. He made what is vulgarly called a sensation, wherever he came,
and even before he reached a place. His great talent was to make ex-

’ tempore verses (improvvisare) (c. 8) : he was a man for display, a wordy

Greek. Quintilian (Inst. x. 7, 19) mentions this talent of Archias, but
only on the authority of Cicero. Archias next visited the south of Italy,
and received among other distinctions the citizenship in Tarentum, Rhe-
gium, and Neapolis. In Ro. 102, in the consulship of Marius and
Catulus, he came to Rome where he got the patronage of the Luculli, and
he retained the friendship of this powerful family to the last. Cicero
(c. 3) using a Roman expression says that Archias was a very young man
(praetextatus) when he came to Rome. He must have been a mere boy,
if we give to this word its proper meaning. The Luculli received him
well, says Cicero, who means L. Lucullus, the father, and his sons Lucius
who afterwards conducted the war against Mithridates, and Marcus.
But the sons were still boys, In Bc. 102 L. Lucullus the father had
the command of the Roman troops in the Servile war in Sicily.
Drumann maintains that Archias accompanied Lucullus the father to
Sicily, and his authority for this assertion is Cicero (c. 4). But this
depends on the reading of tha-t passage (cum L. Lucullo), on the in-
terpretation of the words ‘Interim satis longo intervallo,’ and on the
words ‘ cum eodem Lucullo decederet! There are many objections to
Drumann's opinion, and it seems more likely that ⁴ cum L. Lucullo’
should either be ‘ cum M. Lucullo’ (c. 4, note); or that the son L.
Lucullus is meant. If Archias came to Rome in B.o. 102, he could not
