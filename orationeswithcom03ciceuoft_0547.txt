judiciisque sublatis ἓ

rapinas se cum exercitu suo contulit: domum oppugnare, itineri-
bus occurrere, vi lacessere et terrere coepit. Non movit hominem
summa gravitate summaque constantia: sed quamquam dolor

animi, innata libert-as, prompta excellensque virtus fortissimum

virum hortabatur, vi vim oblatam, praesertim saepius, ut frangeret
et refutaret, tanta moderatio fuit hominis, tantum consilium, ut
contineret dolorem neque eadem se re ulcisceretur, qua esset laces-
situs, sed illum tot jam in funeribus rei publicae exsultantem ac
tripudiantem legum si posset laqueis constringeret. Descendit
ad accusandum. Quis umquam tam proprie rei publicae caussa?
nullis inimicitiis, nullis praemiis, nulla hominum postulatione aut
etiam opinione id eum umquam esse facturum. Fracti erant animi
hominis : hoc enim accusante pristini illius sui judicii turpitudinem
desperabat. Ecce tibi consul, praetor, tribunus plebis nova novi
generis edicta proponunt: “NE Imus ADSIT, NE crrETUR, NE
QUAERATUR, NE MENTIONEM OMNINO CUIQUAM JUDICUM Aur
JUDICIORUM FACERE LICEATff' Quid ageret vir ad virtutem, digni-

used in certain expressions, which are ex-
plained in the note referred to.

ad quotidianam caedem‚] The editions
have before these words ‘ ad ferrum, ad
faces;’ but they are not insome of the
MSS. Compare the use of the word ‘ quo-
tidianus ’ in Pro Caecina, c. 31, 32, and see
the notes (Vol. IL).

nullis praemiis,] In some cases there
was a reward proposed to the prosecutor
(Vol. II. Pro Cluentio, c. 36).—⁴ facturum :⁷
this word depends on ‘ opinione.5

pristini . . ‚judicii turpitudinem despe-
rabah] This is not our way of speaking, but
there is no difficulty about it, though Halm
has copied a whole page of Ferratius to
show what is meant. Clodius had bribed
the judices on his trial for violating the
sanctity of the Bona Dea; and it was a
dirty business, ‹lirty for the judices and for
Clodius too. He could not expect to em-
ploy in this new trial the same disgraceful
means which he had employed in the other,
and of course he could not expect an ac-
quittal. The end of Ferratius’ note is good:
‘⁴ By the exertions of Metellus consul, Ap-
pius praetor, Serranus tr. pl.‚ and the con-
nivauce of the Senate, the coniitia were held
before the trial could begin, and the aedilis

curulis designatus escaped that danger3 for
‘magistratus designati’ could not be pro-
secuted for any thing else than Ambitus,
and Clodius was charged under the Lex
Plautia De Vi.⁷'

judicum aut judiciorum] Halm re-
marks that Cicero's statement is not exactly
true, for the Edictum was, that nothing of
this kind should be done ‘priusquam ju-
dices sorte lecti essent! Dion (39. c. 7)
is the authority for what he says: “Milo
gave notice of a prosecution of Clodius,
but he did not bring it into court. For
neither were the quaestors elected, whose
business it was to determine the judices by
lot; and Nepos forbade the praetor to ad-
mit any prosecution before the judices were
appointed. It was the rule that the aediles
should be elected before the quaestors, and
through this chiefly the delay was occa-
sioned.” Halm further says: “ The orator
also showed his subtilty in this, that hc
quotes the words of the Edictum in such a
way that they may be applied to Clodius
only, ‘Nereus a‹lsit,’ though the meaning
of the Edictum was ‘ Ne quis reus adsit! ”
