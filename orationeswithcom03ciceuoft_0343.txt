ORATIO QUUM POPULO. 329

critics say, for that was a black day, an unlucky day, like all the days
that were next to the Calends, N ones, and Ides. The speech in the
Senate was delivered on the Nonae or fifth of September, as Cicero says
(Ad Att. iv. 1). He then adds : “ Eo biduo quum esset annonae
summa caritas ;’' which two days are the day of his arrival and the next
day on which he thanked the Senate. It seems (Ad Att. iv. 1) that 116
made his Contio about the scarcity also on the fifth of September.
The words ‘eo biduo’ have been misunderstood by some critics. If
Cicero thanked the people as he did the Senatus, it was perhaps on the
day of his return, the fourth of September, though 116 (1063 1101 say in
the letter to Atticus that he did thank the people in a formal speech.
There is some little obscurity about this matter in the letter to Atticus.
Those who will read it carefully may judge if Ι 01· the critics have
understood it best. Klotz’s explanation of the ‘eo biduo ' is not correct.
He understands it 10 1116311 two days after the day on which 116 thanked
the Senate. If it was two full days after, he thanked the people 011 the
eighth of September; but Klotz supposes that it was on the second day
after the fifth of September.

Wolf observes that most of the commentators are not agreed which of
these two orations has the greater merit3 but the majority think that
this oration Ad Quirites is much superior to the other3 one of the
older commentatom, Xicho Polentonus, a man of very great simplicity,
admired in it 3 ‘ divina eloquentia.’

Klotz says: “This speech also, which in its whole character is a inere
echo of the preceding, with the necessary alterations as a matter of
course with reference to the place where it was spoken, has been
declared by some critics to be spurious; but yet for such insufficient
reasons, that in fact one cannot help wondering how an opinion so
untenable could find approval and credit with so many persons.’'—“ The
form of the speech, as well as the several expressions, are however alto-
gether conformable to our orator's usual style of thinking and expres-
sion 3 and here also nothing but misconception could assail particulars.
Accordingly we shall only have little to remark in particular upon this
speech.'’ This is very prudent. He has less than three pages of par-
ticulars upon it, and these three pagos contain nothing. Halm has
intitled this oration ‘⁶ M. Tullii Ciceronis quae fertur Oratio cum populo
gratias egit.” He has omitted the ‘ Quae fertur’ 111 the title of the
Quum Senatui.
