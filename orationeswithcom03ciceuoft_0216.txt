‘202 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA
audivi. Itaque idem ego ille, qui vehemens in alios, qui inexorabilis

in ceteros esse visus sum, persolvi patriae quod debui ; reliqua jam
⁷ a me meae perpetuae consuetudini naturaeque debentur: tam sum
misericors, judices, quam vos; tam mitis quam qui lenissimus. In
quo vehemens fui vobiscum, nihil feci nisi coactus3 rei publicae
praecipitanti subveni: patriam demersam extuli, misericordia
civium adducti tum fuimus tam vehementes quain necesse fuit.
Salus esset omnium amissa una nocte, nisi esset severitas illa sus-
cepta. Sed ut ad sceleratorum poenam amore rei publicae sum
adductus, sic ad salutem innocentium voluntate deducor.

Nihil video esse in hoc P. Sulla, judices, odio dignum, misericordia
digna multa. Neque enim nunc propulsandae calamitatis suae caussa
supplex ad vos, judices, confugit ; sed ne qua generi ac nomini suo
nota nefariae turpitudinis inuratur. Nam ipse quidem, si erit vestro
judicio liberatus, quae habet ornamenta, quae solatia reliquae vitae,
quibus laetari et perfrui possit? Domus erit, credo, exornata;
aperientur majorum imagines3 ipse ornatum ac vestitum recupera-
bit. Onmia, judices, haec amissa sunt: omnia generis, nominis,
honoris insignia atque ornamenta unius judicii calamitate occide-
runt. Sed ne exstinctor patriae, ne proditor, ne hostis appelletur,
ne hanc labem tanti sceleris in familia relinquat, id laborat, id
metuit3 ne denique hic miser conjurati et conscelerati et proditoris

mm nocte,] He may be speaking gene-
rally without meaning any particular night.
Halm suggests tha2 he means either the
night of the second of December on which
the ambassadors of the Allobroges were
seized, or the night of the Saturnalia on
which Rome was to be fired. He may
mean the evening of that day on which the
conspirators were executed, for the prompt
punishment of the leaders terrified all their
pai-rizans. In the oration Pro Flacco, c.
40, 41, he says ‘ O nox illa 3' but there the
meaning seems to be determined by apply-
ing thc words to Flaccus’ services in seizing
the Allobroges.

Nihil rideo] Sylvius refers to Quintilian
(vi. l, 23) who informs us how that part of
the Peroratio which contains the Miseratio
is to be managed—¹ calamitat s suae τ’ his
fall (see Vol. I. Verr. ii. 3. c. 98), after the
conviction in the trial for Ambitus.

imqqineffl] The wax busts of his ances-
tors (Verr. ii. 5. e. 14) which wore kept in
cases in the Atrium. We may suppose thar,
Sulla’s Imaginvs were now boxed up, and
would never be brought out on festal days
or on funerals as the practice was at Rome.

It does not seem probable, Ι think, as
Becker says (Handbuch ii. l. p. 232), that
Sulla lost the privilege of taking his ances-
tors out of their boxes in consequence of
his conviction for bribery 3 I mean that no
such consequence was contained in the Lex.
But as it was the practice for a man in his
condition to avoid display, to live in such
a way as to excite compassion rather than
indignation, it is likely that it was the
fashion for people in his condition to avoid
any display of any kind. Sulla was cunning,
and having got into disgrace‚ he thought
the best thing was to keep quiet and let
all be forgotten. This picture of the degra-
dation of a man whose only offence was
bribery at an election presents a curicus con-
trast with the condition of an English mem-
ber of parliament who has been unseated
for bribery.——‘ vestitum pristinum‚' E.

laic miser] Sulla‘s son who was present.
This was one of the ways of moving pity,
which Quintilian mentions (vi. l, 20:
‘⁶ non solum autem dicendo, sed etiam faci-
endo quaedam lacrimas movemus 3 unde et
producere ipsos qui periclitentur squalidos
atque deformes et liberos eorum ac parentes
