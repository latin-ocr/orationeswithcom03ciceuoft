422 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

esse constarent, aut si M. Horatius ille Pulvillus, qui, quum
eum multi propter invidiam fictis religionibus impedirent, re-
stitit, et constantissima mente Capitolium dedicavit, hujusmodi
alicui dedicationi praefuisset, tamen in scelere religio non valeret,
ne valeat id, quod imperitus adolescens, novus sacerdos, sororis
precibus, matris minis adductus, ignarus, invitus, sine collegis,
sine libris, sine auctore, sine fictore, furtim, mente ac lingua titu-
bante fecisse dicatur; praesertim quum iste impurus atque impius
hostis omnium religionum, qui contra fas et inter viros saepe mulier
et inter mulieres vir fuisset, ageret illam rem ita raptim et turbu-
lente uti neque mens neque vox neque lingua consisteret. LV. De-
latum est ad vos, pontifices et post omnium sermone celebra-
tum, quemadmodum iste praeposteris verbis, ominibus obscenis,
identidem se ipse revocando, dubitans, timens, haesitans omnia
aliter ac vos in monumentis habetis et pronuntiarit et fecerit..
Quod quidem minime mirum est, in tanto scelere tantaque dementia
ne audaciae quidem locum ad timorem comprimendum fuisse.

The story of Pulvillus and of his dedication
of the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline is

tion, but only if Natta had first uttered the
formula, aud that uncertainty is not 15-

told by Livy (ii. 8). His enemies attempted
to stop him in the dedication by announcing
to him the death of his son3 but hc went
on with the ceremony.

fictore] Graevius has a note on the
‘Fictores Pontificu1n‚' a term which occurs
111 501115 inscriptions. They were called, as
Varro (L. L. vii. 44, ed. Miiller) says,
“ Fictores dicti a fingendis libis‚'’

55. Delalum est] Information was
carried to the Pontifices about a thing
which we cannot suppose that they knew
nothing of. ‘⁶ Supra (c. 52) in dubio ponc-
batur, an omnino aliquid dixerit aut fecerit
Pontifex: nunc etiam omnium sermone
celebratum dicitur, quo quidque modo fac-
tum sit et pronuntiatum. Quamquam ex
seqq. intelligitur oratorem nuuc non de
Pinario loqui, sed de Clodio. Quibus tandem
cachinnis talia aegri capitis somnia excepturi
fuissent eruditi, si Ciceronem ridere fas
esset! Jam haec et multa alia, spero, tirun-
culis risum exprimere ” (Wolf). ‘ Docere '
is ⁶ verba praeire.’

Klotz remarks on this remark of Wolf:
“Here also Wolf is doubly 111 51101. For 111
the first place we may easily reconcileCicero’s
speaking (c. 52, and also c. 54) of the dedica-
tion of the Pontifex as of au act altogether
without evidence‚and yet saying here that the
Pontifices were informed how irregularly
every thing had been done. He leaves it in
110 doubt if P. Clodius had done the dedica-

movcd even by this passage. WVhen how-
ever Wolf expresses his surprise that P.
Clodius is now all at once introduced as
speaking and acting, he did not consider
what the proper business of the Pontifex
was 111 such a dedication. The dedication
could only be accomplished hythe Magis-
tratus, and the Pontifex supplied for that
purpose only the words and formulae: he
was, so to spe-ak, only the interpreter or
souffleur (prompter). For this the proper
expressions were ‘praeire' ‘docere' Ac-
cordingly no one cau be surprised, if the
discourse is here chiefly about P. Clodius,
because as tribunus plebis he was the chief
person at the ceremony.’'

The Declamator (c. 54) first speaks of
Natta as ‘novus sacerdosss ‘mente ac lingua
titubante;⁷ then he speaks of Clodius ⁴ iste
impurus’ and how he managed the busi-
ness. Again (c. 55) we have Clodius (iste)
fearing, hesitatiug3 and again we have his
‘perturbatio meutis,’ and his failure in the
ceremony ‘in agendo ruere et saepe peccare,'
his souffleur being compelled to tell him
the formula. though he had never learned
it; which would account very well for the
failure of the whole business. Finally, at
the end of the chapter Clodius (iste) could
not utter 0115 single word which the occa-
sion required. Let any man compare all
this with the part that Natta plays in c. 52,
and decide between the two Germans.
