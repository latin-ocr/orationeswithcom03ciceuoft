'130 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

Catilinam non latus aut ventrem, sed caput 01 collum solere petere,
verum ut omnes boni animadverterent, et quum in metu et periculo
consulem viderent, id quod est factum, ad opem praesidiumque
concurrerent. Itaque quum te, Servi, remissiorem 111 petendo puta-
rent, Catilinam et spe et cupiditate inflammatum viderent, omnes
qui illam ab re publica pestem depellere cupiebant ad Murenam
se statim contulerunt. Magna est autem comitiis consularibus
repentina voluntatum inclinatio, praesertim quum incubuit ad virum
bonum et multis aliis adjumentis petitionis ornatum. Qui quum
honestissimo patre atque majoribus, modestissima adolescentia,
clarissima legatione, praetura probata in jure, grata in munere,
ornata in provincia, petisset diligenter, et ita petisset ut neque
minanti cederet neque cuiquam minaretur, huic mirandum 051
magno adjumento Catilinae subitam spem consulatus adipiscendi
fuisse ἕ

Ν11110 mihi tertius ille locus est relictus orationis de ambitus
criminibus, perpurgatus ab iis qui ante 1110 dixerunt, a me, quoniam
ita Murena voluit, 1·etractandus; quo in loco Postumio, familiari
meo, ornatissimo viro, de divisorum indiciis et- de deprehensis pecu-
niis, adolescenti ingenioso ct bono, Ser. Sulpicio, de equitum centu-
riis, M. Catoni, homini in omni virtute excellenti, de ipsius accusa-
tione, de senatus consulto, de re publica respondebo. XXVII.
Sed pauca, quae meum animum repente moverunt, prius de L. Mu-
renae fortuna conquerar. Nam quum saepe antea, judices, et ex

nostrum ut is nobis eas centurias conficiat.''
Lupus was to visit the ‘centuriae equitum‚’

in its revolutions has seen as great crimi-
nals raised to high estate. Cir-ero says (Pro

S. Ros. Am. c. 29), speaking of Sulla’s
murders: ⁴⁶ Nescimus per ista tempora eos-
dem 1010 sectores fuisse collorum et bono-
rum ? ''

in jura] Murena as ‘praetor urbanus’
(c. 20) had the administration of the law;
and he had got popularitsy by his shows (111
munere).

ambitus] He comes now, and not till
now, to the real matter of the charge, the
third division (c. 5), the only 0110 that 11
really concerned Murena to answer.

divisorum] The ‘divisores’ were the
men who were employed 10 distribute the
bribe money (In Verr. Act. i. c. 8. Vol. L).
See Pro Cn. Plancio, c. 18.-—‘ dc equitum
centuriis? the eighteen ‘centuriae equi-
tum' of Servius Tullius (Livy, i. 43), who
were in the first class. Cicero says (Ad
Fam. xi. 16): “Nune, si mc tanti facis,
quanti certe facis, quoniam equitum centu-
rias tenes in quis regnas, mitte ad Lupum

and to secure them (conficiat). He was the
election agent, the man who was to get the
votes of these ‘centuriae' Natta his step-
son (c. 35) did this job for Murena, and if
he used any means for that purpose, Cicero
argues that Murena was not to be answer-
able for it. A man gets votes for a candi-
date any way, but it must not be presumed
that the candidate knows any thing that his
friends do for him. It must be proved that
he knew and consented, for an enemy might
bribe in order to spoil his election. But
still 110 might presume that the candidate
knows what his friends or his agents are
about. All he may know is that he has to
furnish money for some purpose unknown
to him3 hut that is enough. Money was
paid at Rome for votes; and there was
treating, that is eating and drinking at free
eost 10 1110 honourable voter.
