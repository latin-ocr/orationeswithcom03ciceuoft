CAP. 28, 29. 133

proavo tuo, fortissimo atque florentissimo viro, M. Catoni, incum-
benti ad ejus perniciem, populus Romanus eripuit? Semper in hac
civitate nimis magnis accusatorum opibus et populus universus et
sapientes ac multum in posterum prospicientes judices restiterunt.
Nolo accusator in judicium potentiam afferat, non vim majorem
aliquam, non auctoritatem excellentem, non nimiam gratiam. Va-
leant haec omnia ad salutem innocentium, ad opem impotentium,
ad auxilium calamitosorum, in periculo vero et- in pernicie civium
repudientur. Nam si quis hoc forte dicet Catonem descensurum
ad accusandum non fuisse, nisi prius de caussa judicasset, iniquam
legem, judices, et miseram conditionem instituet periculis hominum,
si existimabit judicium accusatoris in reum pro aliquo praejudicio
valere oportere.

XXIX. Ego tuum consilium, Cato, propter singulare animi mei
de tua virtute judicium, vituperare non possum: nonnulla for-
sitan conformare et leviter emendare possim. Non multa peccas,
inquit ille fortissimo viro senior magister: sed, si peccas, te regere

before the time when the Quaestiones Per-
petuae were established, he proposed a Lex
for the punishment of Galba. It does not
appear what all the terms of the proposed
Lex were. Old Cato, the great grandfather
of the Stoic, now 111 1115 eighty-fifth year,
supported Libo's LeX, and some few frag-
ments of his speech are extant (Gellius,
i. 123 xiii. 24). The man was guilty, and
he only escaped by moving the compassion
of the people : “ Ipse quoque Galba quum
se damnari videret, complexus duos filios
praetextatos et Sulpicii Galli filium eujus
tutor erat, ita miserabiliter pro se locutus
est ut rogatio antiquaretur '' (Liv. Ep. 49).
The excuse of Galba was that the Lusitani
intended to attack him trcacherously, and
he anticipated them. Among the few Lusi-
tani who escaped from Galba’s hands was
Viriathus, who soon found the Romans
plenty to do. (Appian, Hispan. 5u‚ 60.)
Galba's excuse was probably a lie. Appian
of course found 1115 story of Galba's base-
ness somewhere; and, if it is true, it was
one of the most abominable acts of treachery
and cruelty that a man was ever guilty of.
The old man of eighty-four who tried to
bring him to punishment was in this aud
many other things an example of a noble
Roman. (Meyer, Orat. Rom. Frag. ed. ii.;
Rein, Das Criminal-Recht der Romer.)
vim majorem] He may simply mean
that he would not have a prosecutor bring
to a prosecution political power, nor any

unusual force, besides the other things which
he enumerates. But ‘vis major’ has also
a technical meaning which was well-known
to a Roman. It means fire, the earthquake,
the invasion of a country by an enemy who
destroys all before him3 this is ⁴ vis major.’
It is also the violent tempest, storin, hail
and furious wind: this is ‘ vis major.¹ ⁵ Vis
minor ’ 15 blight, mildew, and such things.
Cicero (Pro Cn. Plancio, c. 42) says: ‘⁴ Sin
autem vitam mihi fors ademisset aut vis ali-
qua major reditum peremisset.'’ There is
a passage of Africanus (Dig. 19. 2. 3) in
which ‘ potentia ' and ‘ vis major' come
together as in this passage of Cicero. The
jurisconsult is speaking of a tenant ‘colo-
nus,’ who is prevented by some force from
enjoying what he has hired : “ Sin vero ab
eo interpellabitur quem tu prohibere propter
vim majorem aut potentiam ejus non pote-
ris, nihil amplius ei quam mercedem remit-
tere aut reddere debebis.'’

praejudicio] See Vol. ΙΙ. Index.

29. emendare possim] One MS. has
‘ possmus—A Non multa—magister :’ these
words are cited by Quintilian (Inst. viii. 6.
30). The words which Cicero quotes are
probably from some old writer, Attius or
Ennius as some suppose.-—‘ patitur :' there
is a reading ⁴ patiatur.'—‘ requirimus :’ ‘ we
miss,' as wc say; we seek, and do not find,
though we expect to find: “ Denique isto
bono utare dum adsit; quum absit, ne rc-
quiras '’ (De Seu. c. 10).
