mippo et ab hoc ductus est. XXI. Habetis et honestatem homi-
nis et auctoritatem testimonii et caussam omnem simultatis. Atque
is ab Hermippo missus, quum ei pauca mancipia vendidisset, Romam
se contulit: deinde in Asiam rediit, quum jam frater meus Flacco
successisset, ad quem adiit caussamque ita detulit; recuperatores
vi Flacci coactos et metu falsum invitos judicavisse. Frater meus
pro sua aequitate prudentiaque decrevit, ut, si judicatum negaret,
in duplum iret; si metu coactos diceret, haberet eosdem recupera-
tores. Recnsavit, et, quasi nihil esset actum, nihil judicatum, ab
Hermippo ibidem mancipia quae ipse ei vendiderat petere coepit.
M. Gratidius legatus, ad quem est aditum, actionem se daturum
negavit: re judicata stari ostendit placere. Iterum iste, cui nullus
esset usquam consistendi locus, Romam se rettulit: persequitur
HermippuS, qui numquam istius impudentiae cessit. Petit Hera-
clides a O. Plotio senatore, viro primario, qui legatus in Asia fuerat,

the Actio Depensi, which was the case
here. In other cases a man’s property was
taken.

The creditor had to look after his debtor
himself, and might keep him till he paid.
There was no debtors⁷ prison for the con-
venience of the creditor. What he would
do with the man, I do not know. He must
seed him and lodge him. This practiceoftak-
ing possession ofa debtor's person must have
been very troublesome; and it went out of
fashion, partly because a Lex J ulia allowed
the debtor to make a Cessio bonorum, some-
thing like what an insolvent does in Eng-
land, and from other circumstances.

The old Roman law of debt, which we
have nothing to do with here, is discussed
by Savigny, Vermischte Schriften, ii. Das
Altriimische Schuldrecht, where he has a
remark on this passage3 and some further
remarks on it, vol. iii. p. 387, Tafel von
Heraclea.

judic-alum moyerem] This must mean, if
he disputed the justice of the sentence, for
Heraclides did not deny that the Recupera-
tores had decided against him (falsum . . .
judicavisse). If Heraclides would have a
new trial, he must pay double, if the judg-

leyatus,] We see from this and other
passages that a governor could delegate his
civil power to ‘legati.' Gratidius refused to
allow Heraclides an action: it was his plea-
sure that the ¹ res judicata ' should stand
as it was. The action for which he asked
was for the recovery of the slaves, which
Cicero says he had sold to pay his debt.
As the ‘legatus' thought that the decision
should stand, it appears that this demand
for the slaves and the action in which Her-
mippus had got judgment against Heraclides
were in some way connected3 but Ι (10 not

persequitur Hermippu3‚] Klotz observes
that Hermippus could have no interest in
following him, as Heraclides wanted nothing
from him; but Cicero was disposed to treat
Heraclides as a runa-„vay—Cicero does not
say why Hermippus followed Heraclides,
but he says that he did.

gave up the 6656, which he might do as he
was the plaintiff. The ‘judicium ’ was not
⁶ lege,' that is, Heraclides was not bound to
wait the result of the‘jufficfflm! Heraclides
saw that Naso was going to decide in favour
of Plotius (secundum Plotium).
