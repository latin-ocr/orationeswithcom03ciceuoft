186 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

[Oornelius].-J am si in comparanda familia suspicio est nulla, quod
praefuit nihil ad rem pertinet. Sed tamen munere servili obtulit
se ad ferramenta prospicienda. Praefuit vero numquam3 eaque
res per Bellum, Fausti libertum, omni tempore administrata est.
XX. At enim Sittius est ab hoc in ulteriorem Hispaniam missus
ut eam provinciam perturbaret.—Primum Sittius, judices, L. J ulio
C. Figulo consulibus profectus est aliquanto ante furorem Cati--
linae et suspicionem hujus conjurationis3 deinde est profectus non
tum primum, sed quum in iisdem locis aliquanto ante eadem de
caussa aliquot annos fuisset. Ac profectus est non modo ob caus-
sam, sed etiam ob necessariam caussam, magna ratione cum Mauri-
taniae rege contracta. Tum autem, illo profecto. Sulla procurante
ejus rem et gerente, plurimis et pulcherrimis P. Sittii praediis
venditis aes alienum ejusdem dissolutum [est]‚ ut quae caussa ceteros
ad facinus impulit, cupiditas retinendae possessionis, ea Sittio non
fuerit, praediis deminutis. J am vero illud quam incredibile, quam
absurdum, qui Romae caedem facere, qui hanc urbem inflammare
vellet, eum familiarissimum suum dimittere ab se et amandare in
ultimas terras; utrum quo facilius Romae ea quae conabatur effi-
ceret, si in Hispania turbatum esset Z—at haec ipsa per se sine ulla
quod praefuit]

Halm.

Sed lamen] Orelli writes ‘ sed tantum,'
observing that ‘ tamen ’ and ‘ tantum ’ are
often coufounded. This is true3 but 118
1135 misconceived the whole passage. and
his emendation is worth nothing. Halm
writes ‘ 111 munere servili 3’ and ‘ in ¹ seems
to be wanted. He conjectures that there
has been a transposition, and that the true
order of the words is this: “nihil ad rem
pertinet; praefuit vero numquam. Sed ta-
men in munere servili. . . prospicienda.‘'
I think that all may be right, and ⁴ sed ta-
men . . . prospicienda ' is part of Cicero's
answer. Why could not Sulla look after
arms (ferramenta) ? A gentleman like Sulla
would not undertake the training of those
fellows, but it would be just the thing for
him to sec that their weapons were of pro-
per quality. Cethegus professed to be very
particular about having good arms: “se
semper bonorum ferramentorum studiosum
fuisse” (ln Cat. iii. 0. 5).—‘ Bellum :¹ ‘Bal-
bum,' Halm in his smallcr edition3 but
‘ Bellum’ in the other.

20. Sittius] Seethe Introduction. (“3-
tilina (Sallustius, Cat. e. 21) speaks of
his friend Sittius being in Mauritania.
Appian (Β. C. iv. 54) says that hc lest

trial in which he was prosecuted, and col-
lecting a force in Italy and Spain, passed
over into Africa, and helped first one and
then another of the native kings who were
quarrellingamong themselves. Cicero speaks
of a ‘ magna ratione cum Mauritaniae rege
contracta,' which means some pecuniary
matter. We may guess what it was. Sit-
tius was to serve the barbarian for money,
and 118 got his men in Italy and Spain,
desperate adventurers, such as may always
be had.

procurante] Sulla was his procurator
(vol. 1.. Pro P. Quintio, c. 7), and his ⁴ ne-
gotiorum gestor ' (Vol. IL, Verr. ii. 2,
0. 24).

aes . . . dissolutum] Vol. L, Verr. ii. 3,
0. 77, 11018 011 ‘ dissolvisti 3' and In Cat. ii.
8, note on ‘dissolvis—⁶ cupiditas retinendae?
see In Cat. ii. c. 8.

haec ipsa] what was going on at Rome.
It 15 probable, as Halm remarks, that there
was combination between the conspirators
at Rome and men in 1110 provinces. He
refers to In Cat. iv. 3, “inultas jam pro-
vincias occupavit.'’ There Cicero is exag-
gerating to serve his purpose. llere 110 15
talking in another sense to serve his present
purpose. We know no more than Sallust
