106 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

enim vobis sors campum dedit, in quo excurrere virtus cognoscique
posset. Reliqui temporis spatium in contentionem vocatur. Ab
utroque dissimillima ratione tractatum est. IX. Servius hic nobis-
cum hanc urbanam militiam respondendi, scribendi, cavendi, plenam
sollicitudinis ac stomachi, secutus est: jus civile didicit: multum
vigilavit, laboravit: praesto multis fuit: multorum stultitiam per-
pessus est, arrogantiam pertulit, difficultatem exsorbuit: vixit ad
aliorum arbitrium, non ad suum. Magna laus et grata hominibus,
unum hominem elaborare in ea scientia qnae sit multis profutura.
Quid Murena interea? Fortissimo et sapientissimo viro, summo
imperatori, legatus L. Lucullo fuit; qua in legatione duxit exerci-
tum, signa contulit, manum conseruit, magnas copias hostium fudit,
urbes partim vi, partim obsidione cepit, Asiam istam refertam et
eandem delicatam 510 obiit ut in ea neque avaritiae neque luxuriae
vestigium reliquerit3 maximo in bello sic est versatus ut hic multas
res et magnas sine imperatore gesserit, nullam sine hoc imperator.
Atque haec quamquam praesente L. Lucullo loquor, tamen, ne ab

observari scio ut ejus ista odia non sorbeam

quaestorship; for the lot gave you no room

for your merit to move about in and to be
known.'' Juvenal has (i. 19) :

“Cur tamen hoc potius libeat decurrere
campo.”

A ‘campus ’ is a field, as we say, for the
display of any thing3 and Cicero uses the
word so. “In hoc igitur tanto tam im-
mensoque campo quum liccat oratori vagari
libere ’' (De Or. iii. 31).

in contentionem] We 310 invited to
compare the two men for the time that has
passed since their quaestorship.

9. urbanam militiam] He calls the em<
ployment of Servius an urban warfare. The
occupation of the ‘jurisconsultus ' consisted
in giving answers to cases (respondendi),
writing out things in legal form (scribendi),
and securing his client against 1151( by his
cantion (cavendi). In place of ‘scribere'
Cicero 1135 another word in another place:
⁴* Sin autem quaereretur, quisnam juriscon-
sultus vere nominaretur, eum dicerem qui
legum et consuetudinis ejus qua privati in
civitate uterentur et ad respondendum ct ad
agendum et ad cavendum peritus esset''
(De Or. i. 48). The troubles of the juris-
consult's life are well expressed. The words
‘difficultatem exsorbuit' arc difficult to
translate; they mean, ‘hc had to swallow
all their 1101111105] Cicero says 111 a letter
to his brother (Ad (οὶ. Fr. iii. 9): “De
epistola Vatinii risi. Sed me ab co 113

swallow a thing, but the digestion is difficult.
There are materials in Forcellini (V. Sto-
machus) for the full understanding of Sto-
machus. It is defined by Pliny and by
Cicero (De Nat. Deor. ii. 54) to be the
passage by which the food goes from the
mouth to what we call the stomach; and
Celsus (iv. l) says: “Stomachus vero, qui
intestinorum principium est, nervosus a
septima spinae vertebra incipit, ac circa
praecordia cum ventriculo committitur.”
But it often signifies simply the place where
the food was supposed to be digested; and
hence it is used to express sickness, nausea,
loathing, physical and menta1; or as Cicero
says (Ad Atticum, iv. 16, 10): ‘⁶ Locus ille
animi nostri, stomachus ubi habitabat olim,
concalluit.'’ So the mind has 3 ‘ stomachus‚'
a seat of digestion for what it takes 1ος and
when the digestion of a thing is not easy, it
is said ‘facere aut movere stomachum‚' to
disturb it.

L. Lucullo] In the war against Mithri-
dates. See the Introduction, and Plutarch's
Life of Lucullus.

loquor,] The printed books have gene-
rally ‘loquar,' the. reading of all the MSS.
except one. It was easy to conjecture
‘ loquor,⁷ as Ernesti did, and Halm has
rightly followed Ernesti. The alteration
into ‘loquor' will save. the critics the trou-
ble of explaining ‘loquan’ Lucullus was
