CAP. 18—20. 457

deflexisset. Secutus est O. Gracchus3 quo ingenio ! qua eloquentia l
quanta vi ἱ quanta gravitate dicendi ! ut dolerent boni onmes non illa
tanta ornamenta ad meliorem mentem voluntatemque esse conversa.
Ipse [L.] Saturninus ita fuit effrenatus et paene demens ut auctor
esset egregiuS, et ad animos imperitorum excitandos inflammandos-
que perfectus. Nam quid ego de P. Sulpicio loquar? cujus tanta
in dicendo g1·avitaS‚ tanta jucunditas, tanta brevitas fuit, ut posset
vel ut prudentes errarent vel ut boni minus bene sentirent perficere
dicendo. Cum his conflictari, et pro salute patriae quotidie dimi-
care, erat omnino illis qui tum rem publicam gubernabant molestum,
sed habebat ea molestia quandam tamen dignitatem.

XX. Hic vero, de quo ego ipse tam multa nunc dico, pro dii
immortales! quid est, quid valet, quid affert, ut tanta civitas, si
cadet, quod dii omen obruant, a viro tamen confecta videatur? qui
post patris mortem primam illam aetatulam suam ad scurrarum
locupletium libidines detulit; quorum intemperantia expleta, in
domesticis est germanitatis stupris volut-atus; deinde jam robustus

L. Saturninus]
paene demens ς’

He was ‘effrenatus et mark these means as something peculiar3
his favourite ⁴ paene’ and brevity‚ as a positive quality, is not

(Quum Senatui, c. 15, note), but he means
‘plane’ here, as Wolf remarks, who also
says : “Ego vero dubitem, an multum effi-
caciae habeat laus Saturnini, quae talis est ut
eam etiam sibi sine ulla arrogantia vindicare
potuerit Clodius.'' He adds: “ Sed hoc
videmus, quum dixisset Declainator Ipse L.
Saturninus, non succurrisse ei aptiores sen-
tentias et ad hunc tribunum proprie perti-
nentes: ita amphoram instituit infelix arti-
fex, sed exiit, ut saepe, urceolus.''

P. Sulpicio] P. Sulpicius Rufus, tr. pl.
B.c. 88, one of the faction of C. Marius,
lost his life in the civil commotions of that
time. He left no written speeches, but
Cicero (Brutus, c. 55) says he was one of
the first of orators: liis lauguage was rapid
and flowing, but yet not redundant or dif-
fuse (De Or. i. 293 iii. 3; Plutarch, Marius,
e. 34, 353 Sulla, c. 10). Sulpicius could
either mislead the wise or make the honest
think like dishonest men, as we are here told.
An oratorical power of this kind is certainly
rare. We can understand how a elever
orator might mislead the foolish or bring
the dishonest to bad counsels; but the De-
clamator always misses the point. However‚
let it be so. Sulpicius accomplislied this
by the dignity of his language and his sua-
vity, which we can understand; but I do
not understand how brevity could help him.
For when we speak of the means by which
he accomplished his purpose, we mean to

adapted to persuade. WVhen Cicero cha-
racterizes Sulpicius' oratory as ¹ yet not re-
dundant or diffuse,' he clearly excludes brc-
vity. He means that brevity was not a
characteristic of his oratory, but fulness,
and he guards against the conclusion of this
fulness being in excess by the words which
Ι have quoted.

I have never yet found an instance in
which the Declamator, vvhcn contrasted
with Cicero, thought or wrote like him.
Such a sentence as this might pass un-
observed by those who have exercised their
judgment very little, but I believe that all
men of sound sense will here find evidence
that the man is an impostor.

20. eqo ipse] Markland could see no
meaning in ‘ipses It is to be explained,
says Klotz, by reference to ‘Cum his con-
flictari . . . erat omnino illis,' &c

omen obruant.l The usual word is
‘avertant.’ Markland finds fault with ‘ ob-
ruant.' Gesner thinks it is an elegant meta-
phor, though it is not found elsewhere.
Wolf observes that this use of the verb has
not yet been discovered in Cicero and never
will: “ quandoquidem reperiri nequit, quod
non inest: qua dere diligentium Criticorum
certiora sunt responsa quain Haruspicum
ista aut Lexicograpliorum '’. (Wolf).

qermanitatis] The word, as Markland
observes, occurs in Livy (40. c. 8), where it
means ‘ brotherhood.’ So it seems, as Wolf
