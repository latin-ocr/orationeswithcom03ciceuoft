ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

ullius boni spem haberet in eo, cujus primum tempus aetatis palam
fuisset ad omnium libidines divulgatum? qui ne a sanctissima
quidem parte corporis potuisset hominum impuram intemperantiam
propulsare, qui quum suam rein non minus strenue quam postea
publicam confecisset, egestatem et luxuriam domestico lenocinio
sustentavit, qui, nisi in aram tribunatus confugisset, neque vim
praetoris, nec multitudinem creditorum nec bonorum proscriptionem

effugere potuisset.

Quo in magistratu nisi rogationem de piratico

bello tulisset, profecto egestate et improbitate coaetus piraticam
ipse fecisset ς ac minore quidem cum rei publicae detrimento quam
quod intra moenia nefarius hostis praedoque versatus est3 quo
inspectante ac sedente legem tribunus plebis tulit, ne auspiciis

proposed the Rogatio which gave Pompeius
the command in the war against the pi-
rates.

The foul allusions of the writer in the
words ‘amatorem suum’ (c. 4) ‘ne a sanc-
tissima quidem parte corporis’ require no
explanation. Hotmann has a singularly
silly note on this passage, for which he is
reproved by Graevius3 and Wolf says of it,
“ Mirere ubi hanc partem quaesierit Hoto-
manus de mysteriis quibusdam loquens quae

maxime occultentur idemque comparat pseu· ,

dothyrum c. 6.” But the Declamator is
not satisfied with saying this once. He
says it again with some small variation (De
Domo, c. 24).

aram tribunatus] The sanctity of the
tribunate protected him against the prae-
tor's authority during his year of office,
against his creditors, and against being sold
up (bonorum proscriptionem3 Vol. ΙΙ. Pro
P. Quintio, c. 15, note).

quo inspectante] This is explained by a
passage in the oration Pro Sestio, c. 15,
“iisdem consulibus (Piso and Gabinius) se-
(lentibus,’' Sec. The transitiou from Gabi-
nius' tribunate to his consulship is very
abrupt, and the passage would be unintelli-
gible if we did not know the facts. Klotz
says that this hasty transition is not so
offensive as Wolf assumes it to be. Let
each man judge.

auspiciis] The effect of such a Rogatio
was to abolish the rcligious ceremonial
with which all public business commenced;
and to nullify the ¹ obnuntiatio,’ which was
a declaration by an augur or competent
magistratus that some bad omen preventcd
the ineeting (concilium) or Comitia from
being held.

The passages which relate to the Lex
Aelia et Fufia arc collected in Orelli's In-

dex Legum. Cicero often mentions the
Lex. In the oration De Haruspicum Re-
sponsis, c. 27, the writer speaks of the two
Leges Aelia et Fufia. Orelli thinks it pro-
bable that there was only oue Lex, but it is
a difficult matter to decide. One object of
the Lex or of the Leges was to give to
Magistratus the power of preventing or dis-
solving the Comitia by the ‘obnuntiatio’
(Pro Sestio, c. 153 Phil. ii. c. 32). The
date of the Lex or of the Leges is not cer-
tain; but they were in force before the
troublesome times of the Gracchi. In the
oration against Piso (c. 5) he mentions the
enactment of the Lex Aelia et Fufia as
having been made about a hundred years
before the time to which he there alludes.
There is a remark at the end of the sen-
tence (quae nostri majores . . . voluerunt)
which is Cicero’s. The nature of the ‘tri-
bunitia potestas ' has been explained (Vol.
ΙΙ. De Lege Agraria, ii. c. 37). It was the
Roman liberty. But it required curbing
sometimes, and it was curbed by religion.
Machiavelli has well comprehended the re-
ligious principle os the Roman State in a
few chapters (Discorsi, l, cc. 12-15). He
begins by saying that “those princes or
those states, which would maintain them-
selves uncorrupted, must above every thing
maintain incorrupt the ceremonies of religion
and keep them in veneration.’' The nobles
made use of religion to check the violence
of the popular party headed by the Tribuni3
and though the nobles often cared not for
religion, the people did. Clodius by his
measures was destroying the foundations
on which the existence of Rome reposed3
and it was inevitablc that there must be a
revolution when the respect to religion aud
its ceremonial was gone. Machiavelli says
when he is speaking of the agitation of
