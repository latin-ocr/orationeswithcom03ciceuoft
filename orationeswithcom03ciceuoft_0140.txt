126 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

est mos et voluntati et dignitati tuae. Sed tota illa lex accusationem
tuam, si haberes nocentem reum, fortasse armasset: petitioni vero
refragata est. Poena gravior in plebem tua voce efflagitata est;
commoti animi tenuiorum ε exsilium in nostrum ordinem; concessit
senatus postulationi tuae, sed non libenter duriorem fortunae com-
muni conditionem te auctore constituit. Morbi excusationi poena
addita est : voluntas offensa multorum, quibus aut contra valetudi-
nis commodum laborandum est, aut incommodo morbi etiam ceteri
vitae fructus relinquendi. Quid ergo, haec quis tulit? Is qui
auctoritati senatus, voluntati tuae paruit: denique is tulit, cui
minime proderant. Illa quae mea summa voluntate senatus fre-
quens repudiavit‚ mediocriter adversata tibi esse existimas? Con-
fusionem suffragiorum flagitasti, prorogationem legis Maniliae,

purnia de ambitu, which took its name
from the consul C. Calpurnius Piso. It
was severe enough, says Cicer03 bnt Ser-
vius seeing that the eanvass of Murena was
successful. urged Cicero and the senate to
pass a stricter Lex, the Lex Tullia de am-
bitu.

fortunae communi] ‘Senatorum' says
Sylvius.

Morbi carus-alieni] ‘ Exeusatio ’ is the
name ot' a legal excuse. “ Est et hoc genus
excusationis, si quis se dieat domicilium non
habere Romae delectus ad munus ’⁷ (Frag.
Vat. De Excusatione, ξ 204). Manutius
supposes that Servius proposed that all
voters should be compelled by a clause in
the Lex to come to the ‘comitia' under
some penalty, and that illness should not
be a valid excuse. But this is not the
meaning. It seems that Servius was pro-
posing a clause in the new Lex de ambitu,
which should not allow illness to be a valid
excuse for not appear-ing in court on a trial
De ambitu when a man was summoned.
The consequence would be that sick persons
must appear in court to the injury of their
health, or, if they did not appear, they must
in addition to the illness ‘relinquish the rest
of the advantages of life) lt is difficult to
know what the orator means, for he does
1101. tell 115 what 1110 1055 would be. But if
they were required to appear in court when
summoned, and if illness was no legal ex-
cuse, it is plain that there must have been
some penalty for non-appearance, or the
Lex would have had no force.

quis tulit 5²] Cicero ‘tulin’ and could
get nothing by it except unpopularity.
⁴ Illa quac ’ 15 explained by what follows.

Consu-sionem] Servius proposed that the
votes should not be taken in the usual way,

beginning with the votes of the first class,
but that the people should all vote together
without any distinction of class or century.
Livy (26. c. 18): “Jussi deinde inire con-
fusum suffragium ad unum omnes non cen-
turiae modo sed etiam homines P. Scipioni
imperium esse in Hispania jusserunt.” The
note of P. Manutius on this passage of
Cicero explains it thus: ‘⁶ Servius proposed
that when the votes had been given, the
‘centuriae’ should not be counted accord-
ing to the usual practice, but that all the
votes of all the ¹ centuriae ’ should be mixed,
and by counting them it should be ascer-
tained who was elected consul, and who was
rejected3 the result would be to destroy
bribery, as the vote of no century would
appear.''

The prorogation of the Manilia Lex is
obscure; most of the Commentators, except
Garatoni, assume that it was a Lex pro-
posed by the tr. pl. Manilius for distributing
the votes of 1110 ‘libertini’ among all the
tribes. But all about this Lex, if there ever
was one, is quite uncertain. Nor is there
any explanation of what is meant by the
‘prorogatio ’ of a Lex 3 for either the Lex
existed, and was in force; or it had never
been enacted, though it had been p1·oposed;
or it had been enacted, and was repealed.
But the word ⁴ prorogatio' applies to none
of these cases. Or, it was enacted for a
limited time, and the time was near its end.
The reading of E. G. M. and some other
MSS. is ‘pi-erogationem,’ which may mean
⁶ perrogationein,’ as Mommsen conjectures,
and Ilahn accepts it.

This mode of taking the votes would have.
been very displeasing to many people, for it
eonfounded all the. votes in 0110 mass, Un-
der the existing system it was well known
