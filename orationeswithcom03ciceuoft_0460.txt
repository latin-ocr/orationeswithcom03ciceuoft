446 ORAT. DE HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS

ipso consessu et constrictum spectaculis atque impeditum turba et
angustiis tradidisset. An, si ludius constitit aut tibicen repente
conticuit, aut puer ille patrimus et matrimus si terram non tenuit
aut tensam, aut lorum amisit, aut si aedilis verbo aut simpulo
aberravit, ludi sunt non rite facti, eaque errata expiantur, et mentes
deorum immortalium ludorum instauratione placantur3 si ludi ab
laetitia ad metum traducti [sunt], si non intermissi, sed perempti
atque sublati sunt, si civitati universae scelere ejus, qui ludos ad
luctum conferre voluit, exstiterunt dies illi profesti paene funesti,
dubitabimus quos ille fremitus nuntiet ludos esse pollutos? Ac si
volumus ea quae de quoque deo nobis tradita sunt reeordari, hanc
Matrem magnam, cujus ludi violati, polluti, paene ad caedem et ad
funus civitatis conversi sunt, hanc, inquam, accepimus agros et
nemora cum quodam strepitu fremituque peragrare. Haec igitur
vobis, haec populo Romano et scelerum indicia ostendit et pericu-
lorum signa patefecit.

XII. Nam quid ego de illis ludis loquar, quos in Palatio nostri

dentium,' Klotz, Baiter. Can any body stands here means if ‘¹ he has not stuck to

tell how the ‘stans senatus' followed the
‘ vox, aspectus,' and ‘impetus ’ of Cn. Len-
tulus, or what the Senate, equites, and ‘boni’
did after being delivered up bound, &c. to
the multitude ?

Au, Si ludius] Arnobius, Adv. Gentes,
iv. p. 148 (edit. Heraldi, p. 186), quoted by
Markland, has the following passage: ⁴‘ In
ceremoniis vestris rebusque divinis postilioni-
bus locus est, et piaculis dicitur contracta
esse commissio, si per imprudentiae lapsum
aut in verbo quispiam aut simpuvio deerra-
rit, aut si rursus in solemnibus ludis curri-
culisque divinis commissum omnes statim
in religiones clamatis 530135, 51 111(11115 0011-
stitit, aut tibicen repente conticuit, aut si
patrimus ille qui vocitatur puer omiserit
per ignorantiam lorum aut terram (tensam)
tenere 11011 potuit.” Either Arnobius took
the latter part of this extract from this
oration, 01· 110 and the Declaxnator took it
from the same place. Markland 111 quoting
this passage writes ‘terram tenere,’ but
Baiter, who also quotes it, writes ⁸ tensam
tenere 3’ and in his text he writes ‘ si tensam
non tenuit.' ⁴ Terram tenere ⁷ means ‘ ma-
nibus tangere,’ as Wolf shows. “ If a
dancer stood still, or a ⁶ tibicen ’ all at once
became mute. or the youth whose father
and mother are still alive did not touch the
earth ’'——so far is plain z but Baiter follows
Ant. Augustinus, aud reads ‘ si tensam non
tenuit, si lorum omisit.' The text as it

the ‘ tensa' or vehicle, or 1135 lost- the rein.”

simpulo] ‘ simpuvio,’ Arnobius, Baiter,
Juven. vi. 343 ε ‘¹ if the aedile made a mis-
take either in a word or in the vcsscl of
libation.”—‘profesti τ’ ‘ pro festis‚' Baiter.

μεν-3913110] Wolf says that Garatoni
and himself were surprised that it is not
‘peragi-asse! One wonders that they can
be surprised at any thing in this writer.
But it is plain that ‘ peragrare' expresses
the writer's meaning. He had heard that
the Mater Magna did walk about, was wont
to walk about ‘ cum quodam strepitu
fremituque ;' and she therefore has dis-
played “ 10 the Roman people the evidence
of crimes and the signs of dangers.'' If she
had not been accustomed to walk about
with a ⁶ strepitus ' and ¹ fremitus.’ but had 011
11115 occasion done so, the Declamator’s con-
clusion would have been better. The whole
chapter is ridiculous. Klotz says that the
present ⁴ peragrare ' is used by Cicero pur-
posely to leave it uncertain whether the 301
15 10 be considered as complete or 1101.
“ If he had said ⁶ peragrasse,⁷ this objectiou
might have been rcadily made to him.
Those are ‘tempi passati ς’ 31 1110 present
day she can no longer do it.”

12. de illis ludis] Manutius thought it
necessary to tell us that the writer seems to
be going to speak of other Ludi, but yet he
is speaking of the Megalesia; and so it is.
The Declamator also says that the Ludi
