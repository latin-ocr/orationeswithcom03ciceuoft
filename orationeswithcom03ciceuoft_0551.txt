OAP. 42—44. 537

vocaret: alterum Thracibus ac Dardanis primum pacem maxima
pecunia vendidisse; deinde, ut illi pecuniam conficere possent,
vexandam iis Macedoniam et spoliandam tradidisse; eundemque
bona creditorum, civium Romanorum, cum debitoribus Graecis
divisisse, cogere pecunias maximas a Dyrrachinis, spoliare
Thessalos, certam Achaeis in annos singulos pecuniam imperavisse,
neque tamen ullo in publico aut religioso loco signum aut tabulam
aut ornamentum reliquisse: hos sic illudere, quibus omne suppli-
cium atque omnis jure optimo poena debetur3 reos esse hos duos,
quos videtis. Omitto jam Numerium, Serranum, Aelium, quisqui-
lias seditionis Clodianae : sed tamen hi quoque etiam nunc volitant,
ut videtis ; nec, dum vos de vobis aliquid timebitis, illi umquam de
se pertimescent.

XLIV. Nam quid ego de aedile ipso loquar, qui etiam diem
dixit et accusavit de vi Milonem? Neque hic tamen ulla umquam
injuria adducetur, ut eum tali virtute tantaque firmitate animi se in
rem publicam fuisse poeniteat: sed, qui haec vident adolescentes,
quonam suas mentes conferent? Ille, qui monumenta publica, qui

on this occasion, or Dion’s speech for him,
is in Dion, 36. c. 10.

alterum Thracibus] Piso. The Dar-
dani were in the higher Moesia. The
attack of the Thracians on Macedonia is
mentioned in the De Prov. Cons. c. 2,
where the matter is stated a little differently.
There is something about the Apolloniatae
in the In Pison. c. 35; and about the
Dyrrachini and others in the In Pison.
c. 34, and the De Prov. Cons. c. 3.

The Achaei are here mentioned as under
Piso’s jurisdiction3 and as he has mentioned
the Thessali, he may intend by the term
Achaei to designate the states south of Thes-
saly. See Pro Flacco, c. 26, and the note on
Achaea.

publico aut reliyioso] On the word
‘religiosus' see Vol. II. Pro C. Rabirio,
c. 2, note. A ‘locus publicus' is a place
set apart for public use.

lzos sic illudere‚] Halm (l). In (2) he
has written ‘illos sic illudere‚' but the MSS.
which he cites have ⁴ hos,’ and ‘illos' is a
correction made in order to correspond to
‘ hos duos! Wesenberg proposes to write
‘eos' for ‘hos.⁷ Halm (l) gives some
good reasons sor retaining ‘hos‚’ and I
think it may be right. ‘Hos' is more
emphatic 3 and these ⁴ hos ''are distinguished
from the other, for he says ‘ hos duos, quos
videtis ;’ which addition ‘quos videtis '

seems to me clear proof that he had already
said ‘ hos ' before, and not ‘illos ’ or ⁴ eos.’
Garatoni proposed to write ‘ eludere,’ which
conjecture, says Halm, Wesenberg has
learnedly proved to be unnecessary 3 if the
proof was necessary. The infinitive ‘illu-
dere ' depends on ⁴ quum sciat,’ ⁴ knowing
. . . that they are playing such an insolent
art.’
p 44. aedile ipso] P. Clodius (De Harusp.
c. ll).—‘ diem dixit et accusavit Milonem :'
‘diem dicere’ has a dative, but here the
accusative depends on ‘accusavit' (Vol. I.
De Divin. c. 20: ‘⁸ scimus M. Silano diem
dixisse '’) Valerius Maximus (vi. l. 7):
“ M. Claudius Marcellus aedilis curulis C.
Scantinio Capitolino tribuno pl. diem ad
populum dixit.’⁷ lt seems that ⁶ diem
dicere' is said of a magistratus and the
tribuni plebis (Pro Sex. Rosc. Am. c. 12,
note; Pro Flacco, c. 32). ‘Diem dixi&
he gave him notice of the prosecution. Then
Cicero adds ‘accusavit :' he stated the charge
against Milo and undertook thelprosecution.
Milo was prosecuted before Sestius, and yet
he was still ‘ reus' when Sestius was ac-
quitted (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 3). His trial had
been adjourned (Manutius).

monumenta publica,] The Porticus of
Catulus (De Domo, c. 44, note); ‘aedos
sacras,’ the temple of the Nymphae (De
Harusp. c. 27); ‘domos inimicorum,’ the
house of M. Tullius and Quintus, and of
