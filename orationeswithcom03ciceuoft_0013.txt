To THE

ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA.

THE four speeches of Cicero against Catilina are part of the materials
that we possess for the history of a conspiracy against the Roman State.
The chief conspirator, L. Sergius Catilina, belonged to a patrician gens,
which had several branchos. The branch to which Catilina belonged
had the name of Silus. His great-grandfather, Μ. Sergius Silus, served
in the second Punic war, and he was Praetor B.C. 197 (Liv. 32, c. 27),
the first year in which six Praetors were elected. There is 3 denarius
which bears the name of M.. Sergius Silus, and is supposed to have been
struck in honour of him by his son M. Sergius Silus. The son was a
legatus under the consul Aemilius Paullus in the Macedonian war,
B.c. 168. He left a son, Sergius Silus, whose praenomen is unknown.
This unknown man had a son named L. Sergius Catilina, who was pro-
bably,about two years older than Cicero, and born in Ro. 108. This
conclusion is derived from the year of his praetorship Ro. 68, and from
the assumption that he obtained this magistracy at the earliest age that
he could.

L. Sergius Catilina inherited a great name and the rank of Patrician
without much fortune. He had a strong body and a vigorous under-
standing. He loved pleasure, and from his early youth lived a life of
luxury and dissipation. He could however endure pain and toil, and he
did not fear danger. He had abilities, passions, and courage, and his
enemies tell us that he never scrupled at employing any means to
accomplish his ends.

In 1116 time of Sulla’s proscriptions he murdered his own brother
(Plutarch, Cicero, c. 10), and many Roman equites. In B.o. 73 he was
tried for having sexual commerce with a Vestal, Fabia, 3 half-sister of
Cicero’s wife Terentia: but he was acquitted. Sallust and Plutarch tell
us other things about him, some of which may not be true, though they
were said and believed (Sallust, Cat. c. 5 3 c. 14, 320. Plutarch, Cicero,
