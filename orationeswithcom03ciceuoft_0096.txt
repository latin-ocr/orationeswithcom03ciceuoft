quoted by Halm, proves that the Scribae of
the Quaestores and Aediles were nearly ex-
clusively ‘ingenui' (De apparitoribus ma-
gistratuum Romanorum, Neues Rhein. Mus.
vi. s. l ff). This explanation is supposed
to remove Cicero's inconsistency in speak-
ing of the ‘scribaess who were generally
‘ libertini ’ or manumittet} slaves, then men-
tioning ‘ingenui,' and 111011 again speaking
of the class of ‘libertinis But I do not
think that there is any inconsistency 111 this.
After speaking of the ‘ scribae,' who formed
an ⁴ ord0,' 110 speaks of ‘libertini homines’
generally, and not of those ‘libertini ’ who
belonged to the ‘ordo ' of the ⁴ scribae.’ If
some of 1110 ⁴ scribae ’ were ‘ingenui,' it is
certain that all were not. The factos the
‘ scribae ’ of the Quaestores and Aediles
being ‘ingenui ’ does not, Ι think, remove
the objection that is made, for all who are
‘ scribae: ‘ingenui’ or not, are mentioned
before the ‘ ingenui! It seems a very sim-
ple matter. He enumerates the ‘scribae'
as an ‘ordo;' and all members of this ‘ordo’
were thus distinguished both from ‘ingenui’
and ‘libertini ' who did not belong 1011.

8. qnantum potest—rolvmlatls.] This
is the connexion of the words. Such words
as ‘quantum ’ with ‘posse ’ and ‘velle' and
some others are often thus placed with re-
spect to the genitive.

ing 111 an abusive word. (See Vol. II. l‘ro.

haec 111 senatu aguntur, liberti et pauci ex
clientibus Lentuli divorsis itineribus opifices
atque servitia in vicis ad eum eripiendum
solicitabant ;’⁷ and Appian (B. C. ii. 5) says
the same. (The word ‘concursare' is ex-
plained Vol. I. Verr. ii. 5. c. 31.)—⁴ sellaez⁷
‘ sella‚' a diminutive of ‘sedes‚’ means here
the seat of the man who exercises some
sedentary art, a cobbler, a tailor. To such a
man his little seat, or bench, or stand where
he exercises his craft (opus) and makes his
money is every thing: it is his alh—‘taber-
nis :' a ‘taberna ' is thus defined by Ulpian
(Dig. 50. 16. 183): “Tabernae appellatio
declarat omne utile ad habitandum aedifi-
cium, nempe ex eo, quod tabulis clauditur.''
He supposes that it contains the same root
as ‘ tabula ;’ which may be true. The word
generally means any place where a man
practises his art or sells things, wine, books,
or any thing else. Many of these were pro-
bably small places chiefly constructed of
wood, and not used as dwelling houses3 or
they might serve as a lodging for the little
shopkeeper‚ who had his snug bed (lectulus)
there. At night they were secut-ed by a chain,

“ Postquam omnis ubique
Fixa catenatae siluit compago taba-mest
(Juvenal, iii. 303.)

A ‘taberna instrueta' is one “quae et rebus
et hominibus ad negotiationem paratis con-
stat '’ (Ulpian, Dig. 50. 16. 185 ς Pro
Cluentio, c. 63). The ‘instrumentum ’ is
the fittings as we call them of the shop, and
all that is in it fm- the purpose of the trade.
Cicero has well described the character of
the shopkeeper, the man whose existence
