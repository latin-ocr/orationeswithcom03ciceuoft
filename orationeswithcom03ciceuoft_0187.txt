GAP. 10, 11. 173

nolebat, non intelligebat ea quae clare diceret ita illos audituros
quibus se venditabat, ut vos quoque audiretis qui id non probabatis3
deinde alterum jam oratoris vitium, non videre quid quaeque caussa
postulet. Nihil est enim tam alienum ab eo, qui alterum conjura-
tionis accuset, quam videri conjuratorum poenam mortemque lugere.
Quod quum is tribunus plebis facit, qui unus videtur ex illis ad
lugendos conjuratos relictus, nemini mirum est: difficile est enim
tacere quum doleas. Te, si quid ejusmodi facis, non niodo talem
adolescentem, sed in ea caussa in qua te vindicem conjurationis
velis esse, vehementer admiror. Sed reprehendo tamen illud
maxime, quod isto ingenio et prudentia praeditus caussam rei
publicae non tenes, qui arbitrere plebi Romanae res eas non pro-
bari, quas me consule omnes boni pro salute communi gesserunt.
XI. Ecquem tu horum qui adsunt, quibus te contra ipsorum volun-
tatem venditabas, aut tam sceleratum statuis fuisse ut haec onmia
perire voluerit, aut tam miserum ut et se perire cuperet, et nihil
haberet quod salvum esse vellet? An vero clarissimum virum
generis vestri ac nominis nemo reprehendit, qui filium suum vita
privavit, ut· in ceteros firmaret imperium3 tu rem publicam repre-

quid quaeque caussa] To know what to
say on every occasion, and not to say what
ought not to be said, is a great part of the
orator's art, as it is also a great part of
prudence in all the affairs of life. Tor-
quatus, according to Cicero’s representa-
tion, had fallen into contradictions, as an
orator, and as a man. Halm refers to
Cicero, De Or. ii. c. 72, and De Invent. i.
c. 50, for some observations 011 this matter.

is tribunus] The Scholiast suggests that
it is L. Calpurnius Bestia, or it may be Q.
Metellus Nepos. I do not see that we can
with certainty say who is meant. Sallust
(c. 17) names Bestia among the chief con-
spirators, and in another place (c. 43) he
says : ‘⁴ L. Bestia, tribunus plebis, contione
habita, quereretur de actionibus Ciceronis,
bellique gravissumi invidiam optumo consuli
imponeret.'' This happened after Catilina
had left Rome and reached the territory of
Faesulae. But if Bestia was a conspirator,
he could hardly have escaped the fate of
those who were tried after Catilina's defeat,
Vargunteius and others. When Cicero says
‘is tribunus pl. facit) it seems as if he
meant that the man was now tr. pl.

nou tenes,] ⁴ You do not comprehend or
understand,’ as Halm says, who refers to
In Cat. iii. 7: “ omnia norat, omnium adi-
tus tenebat.'¹ Graevius explains it the same

way: “ignoras quid postulet rei publicae
ratio et utilitas,” which Halm translates, I
suppose, when he says : ‘⁴ du verstehst nicht
worin die eigentliche Volkssache beruht.”
In the De Legibus (iii. 4) Cicero says:
‘⁴ Senator . . . caussas populi teneto‚’' ‘let
the Senator defend the interests of the
Populus)

ll. venditabas] In c. 10, ‘quibus se
venditabat.y He says (De Am. c. 23):
“ quamquam a multis virtus ipsa contemni-
tur et venditatio quaedam atque ostentatio
esse dicitur.'’ The meaning of the word is
easily understood. The eagerness of a man»
who eries his wares for sale, knife-dealer,
sponge-seller, or whatever else, furnished
the Romans with a happy expression. They
said of a man who is very eager to recom-
mend himself, to show himself off, that he
was selling himself.

clarissimum] The, stern consul T. Man-
lius Torquatus, who put his son to death
in the Latin war (Livy 8. c. 7) because he
had fought in a single combat with the
enemy against his father's orders. Mat-hia-
velli (Discorsi, iii. e. 22) has a good cliap-
ter on the consul Manlius Torquatus3 and
Cato‚· in liis speech on the punishment of
the conspirators, mentions the punishment
of this bravc young Roman (Sallust, Cat.
c. 52).
