INTRODUCTION. 293

marriage of Pompeius with Caesar’s daughter Julia took place in Bc.
59, the year of Caesar's consulship3 and in the same year Caesar
married Calpurnia, the daughter of L. Piso, one of the consuls of the
year Bc. 58. Caesar, who had got Gallia Cisalpina and Transalpina
with Illyricum for his province, was outside of Rome in the spring of
B.c. 58. There is no reason why he should not have gone northward
earlier than he did, for he was not a man who cared for seasons. He
did not leave the neighbourhood of Rome, as he tells us (B. G. i. 7),
until he heard of the movements of the Helvetii, and he was still at the
gates of Rome while Cicero was on his way to the south of Italy (Dion
Cassius, 38. ο. 17 ; Pro Sestio, c. 18). He was waiting to see how this
affair of Cicero would turn out.

The violence of Clodius and his rabble‚ the fears of Cicero, and the
advice of Cato, Hortensius, and Atticus, made him determine to leave
Rome. L. Lucullus, who was one of his friends, advised him to stay
and to repel force by force. However he left Rome, as he afterwards
said, to save bloodshed (Pro Sestio, c. 22). In the darkness of night he
quitted the city in the month of April (Wolf says March) according to
the Roman Calendar at that time (13.0. 58).

As soon as Cicero had left Rome, Clodius proposed and carried a
Rogatio by which Cicero was laid under the Interdictio aquae et ignis,
the effect of which was to prevent a man from living within the limits
to which the interdiction extended (De Domo, c, 18). The Rogatio
comprehended all places within four hundred Roman miles from Rome,
and was equivalent to a sentence of expulsion from Italy. The consuls
Piso and Gabinius were paid for their services to Clodius: Piso had
the province of Macedonia, and Gabinius had Syria with extraordinary
powers. Cicero’s property was declared forfeited to the State; his
house at Rome on the Palatine was plundered and destroyed3 and his
Tusculan and Formi-an villae were spoiled (Ad Att. iv. 2). The site on
which his house on the Palatine stood was dedicated to Liberty, or as
Cicero says (De Legg. ii. 17 ) more properly to Licentia (vexati nostri
Lares familiares: in eorum sedibus exaedificatum templum Licentiae).
His wife fied with her children to her half-sister Fabia, one of the Vestal
virgins, but she was taken from the temple of Vesta to the bank called
Valeria and compelled to give securities for the delivering up of such
ready money os her husband as she had in her possession. The violence
of these proceedings against Cicero was hardly covered by a show of
legal formality, and a State in which such scandalous outrages could be -
committed was manifestly coming to that condition in which there is
only one chance of safety and one necessary conclusion, the usurpation
of the sovereignty by a man who commands the soldiers.

Cicero heard of these acts of violence when he was on his journey.
