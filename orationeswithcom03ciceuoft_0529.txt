brevi tempore manere libertatem illam, atque hoc etiam, si fieri po-
tuerit, esse majorem, quod cum consulibus illis M. Cato, etiam quum
jam desperasset aliquid auctoritate sua profici posse, tamen voce ipsa
ac dolore pugnavit, et post meum discessum iis Pisonem verbis flens
meum et rei publicae casum vexavit, ut illum hominem perditissi-
mum atque impudentissimum paene jam provinciae poeniteret. Cur
igitur rogationi paruit Z—Quasi vero ille non in alias quoque leges,
quas injuste rogatas putaret, jam ante juraverit l Non offert se
ille istis temeritatibus, ut, quum rei publicae nihil prosit, se civi rem
publicam privet. Consule me quum esset designatus tribunus plebis,
obtulit in discrimen vitam suam; dixit eam sententiam cujus invi-
diam capitis periculo sibi praestandam videbat; dixit vehementer, egit
acriter, ea quae sensit prae se 111111; dux, auctor, actor rerum illarum
fuit; non quo periculum suum non videret, sed in tanta rei publicae
tempestate nihil sibi nisi de patriae periculis cogitandum putabat.

but Halm observes that Cato was now at
Rome.—‘post meum discessum ι’ Manutius
observes that Plutarch (Cat. Min. c. 34)
must be mistaken, when he tells us that
Cato was sent to Cyprus aster Cicero left
Rome. Plutarch says: “Clodius did not
expect to be able to put down Cicero so long
as Cato was at Rome ;’' aud so he contrived
to impose this Cyprian commission on him.

Cur iyitur royalimzz' paruit ?] That is
the question. Why did he go? The an-
swer is that he had already done that which
he would rather not have done3 and there
was no harm in doing a little more of the
same kind. “Significat autem Julias C.
Caesaris leges 111 quas quum diu perseve-
rasset non jurare, ad extremum coactus
suasionibus plurimorum videtur accommo-
dasse consensum’' (Schol.). Halm refers
to Plutarch (Cat. Min. c. 32), a passage
which explains this. He is speaking of
Caesar's Agrai-ian Lex, which contained “a
clause to compel all the Senate to swear
that they would maintain the law and give
their aid against any one who should 361
contrary to it, and they enacted heavy pe-
nalties against those who did not. swear.
All swore to maintain the law under com-
pulsion, bearing in mind what befel Me!-
tellus of old, whom the people allowed to
be driven out of Italy because he would not
swear to observe a like euactment.—But
the person who most persuaded and induced

Cato to take the oath was Cicero the orator,
who argued and urged that perhaps it was
not even right for him 10 think that hc was
the only man who ought to refuse ohedience
to what had been determined by the common
voice; and when it was impossible to undo
what had been done,'it was altogether sense-
less and mad to have 110 regard for hiniselt'3
and of all evils, he argued, it was the great-
est to give up and surrender the state, to
the interest of which all his actions were
directed, 10 111056 who were plotting against
it, as if he were glad to be released from
all struggles in its behalf.'’ This explains

on the duties of his office on the 1v. Id. Dec.
according to the custom at that time (Ma-
nutius). See the Introduction to the ora-
tions against Catilina, and the fourth ora-
tion against Catilina. Halm refers to the
passage in Velleius, ii. 35. about Cato.
