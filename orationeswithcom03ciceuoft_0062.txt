48 ORAT. ΙΙ. ΙΝ L. CATILINAM

illam naufragorum ejectam ac debilitatam manum florem totius
Italiae ac robur educiteat Jam vero urbes coloniarum ac munici-
piorum respondebunt Catilinae tumulis silvestribus. Neque ego
ceteras copias, ornamenta, praesidia vestra cum illius latronis inopia
atque egestate conferre debeo. Sed, si, omissis his rebus omnibus
quibus nos suppeditamus, eget ille, senatu, equitibus Romanis,
[populo,] urbe, aerario, vectigalibus, cuncta Italia, provinciis 0111111-
bus, exteris nationibus: si, his rebus omissis, caussas ipsas quae
inter se confligunt contendere velimus, ex eo ipso quam valde illi
jaceant intelligere possumus. Ex hac enim parte pudor pugnat,
illinc petulantia: hinc pudicitia, illinc stuprum: hinc fides, illinc
fraudatio: hinc pietas, 1111110 scelus: 111110 00115111111111, 1111110 furor:
111110 11011051115, 1111110 turpitudo: 111110 continentia, 1111110 libido:
denique aequitas, temperantia, fortitudo, prudentia, virtutes onmes
certant cum iniquitate, luxuria, ignavia, temeritate, 011111 vitiis
omnibus: postremo copia 011111 egestate, bona ratio 011111 perdita,
mens sana cum amentia, bona denique spes 011111 omnium rerum

ll. naufrayorum] This is a favourite
metaphor with Cicero (In Cat. i. 0. 12). A
shipwrecked man is the emblem of 00111-
plcte destitution. Against these miserable
W1etches the flower of all Italy and the
stlength would be opposed. Horace (Carm.
ii. 1¹5) has the expression ’01 Italum robur‚’
in a difleient sense 115 501110 Commentators
suppose, but not all.

urbe-s· coloniarum] Muretus thinks that
this is 1101 Latin, and he would read ‘ vires.'
Garatoni would read ‘arces' But if we
translate it the ⁴ cities of the coloniae and
the rnunicipia,' there is 110 111010 difficulty
in the expression than 111 ‘urbes Italiae,’
for a ‘colonia’ was a territory and a ‘mu-
nicipium ’ was a territory3 and each terri-
tory had its chief city, and small dependent
places. The ‘tumuli silvestres' are the
hills 011 which hc represents the hands of
Catilina as collvctcd. Tho ‘ citiOS,5 the
walled towns, will hc a match (responde-
bunt) for such places. In c, 12 110 says
“coloni omnes—urbes suas finesque de-
fendeut.”

Svppeslilanncv] Halm has ‘suppedita-
mur,’ and says “ this is the only passage in
which the word occurs in this signification
and construction. Some MSS. have ‘ sup-
pctlita11111s3’ hut the reading 15 made certain
by the testimony of the grammarian Aru-
sianus Messius, who quotes thc passage as
an example of thc expression ‘snppctlitor
hac re.”’ Some of Halm's Mss. have
‘S111›peditannis,' one has 65111111011110111115,’

and two have ‘suppeditabimus.' He does
not say what the others have.

populo,] This word is wanting in the best
MSS. ; but I do not see any difficulty in it,
for Catilina could be said to be without
Senate, Equites, and Populus; and as this
oration is addressed to the Populus, there
is propriety in mentioniug the Populus.
There is much more difficulty in the word
‘ Romanis‚’ for why should he say ‘ equiti-
bus Romanis ?’ I think that Halm's con-
jecture is very probable. One of the MSS.
has ‘equite R. P.,⁷ and he supposes that
the true reading may be ‘equite, re pub-
lica)

Ea: 11αο enim parte] Halm observes that
the simpler rhetoric of the Greeks, or he
might have said of Demosthenes, would not
have allowed this long-spun antithesis. He
compares the passage in the oration against
Leptines, 0. 37. · ἐν τῇ τῶν καθημένων
ὑμῶν ἑιὺς ἑκάστου γνωμῃ φιλαι θρωπία
πρὸς φθόνον καὶ ὂικαιοσίνν η πυὸς κακίαν
καὶ πάντα τὰ χρηστα πρὸς τα ,πονηρό-
τατα (iz τιτιίττεται. Demosthenes' 15 always
more severe and simple than Cicero, and 111
11115 1105 1115 force. If we had 1111- 5110001105
of C. Gracchus, we might perhaps have
found in the Roman a real rival to the
Athenian orator. The fragments of C.
Gracchus justify such a supposition.

bona ratio] The good principle fights
against the bad3 the principle of conscrva-
tion against the principle of confusion.
