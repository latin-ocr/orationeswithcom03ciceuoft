litteras, do multarum artium disciplinam, non adimo sermonis lepo-
rem, ingeniorum acumen, dicendi copiam3 denique etiam, si qua

sibi alia sumunt, non repugno: testimoniorum religionem et fidem w-

numquam ista natio coluit3 totiusque hujusce rei quae sit vis, quae
auctoritas, quod pondus, ignorant. Unde illud est Da mihi testi-
monium mutuum? Num Gallorum, num Hispanorum putatur?
Totum istud Graecorum est, ut etiam qui Graece nesciunt, hoc
quibus verbis a Graecis dici soleat sciant. Itaque videte quo vultu,
qua confidentia dicant3 tum intelligetis qua religione dicant.
Numquam nobis ad rogatum respondent, semper accusatori plus
quam ad rogatum. Numquam laborant quemadmodum probent
quod dicunt, sed quemadmodum se explicent dicendo. Iratus Flacco
dixit M. Lurco, quod, ut ipse aiebat, libertus erat ejus turpi judicio
condemnatus. Nihil dixit quod laederet quum cuperet, impe-
diebat enim religio. Tamen id quod dixit quanto cum pudore,
quo tremore et pallore dixit. Quam promptus homo P. Septimius,
quam iratus de judicio et de villico? Tamen haesitabat3 tamen
ejus iracundiae religio nonnumquam repugnabat. Inimicus M.
Caelius, quod, quum in re manifesta putasset nefas esse publicanum

Hellenes who manage public matters, if
they be trusted with a talent only, and
there be ten men to put their hands to the
writing, and as many seals, and twice the
number of witnesses, cannot keep their
good saith. But among the Romans, both
in the magistracies and foreign missions,
those who handle very large sums of money
obser-ve their duty through their good saith
to their oath. In other nations it is rare to
find a man who keeps his hands off the
public money and who is pure in such
things; but among the Romans it is rare
to find any man detected in such an act.’⁷
Polybius saw the close of Rome‘s heroic
age. In Cicero’s time the Romans no
longer deserved this honourable character.

Da miln'] Δάνεισόν μοι μαρτυρίαντ
“lend me your testimony, and you shall
have mine.”

Cicero shows us a Greek witness, an im-
pudent confident fellow. These witnesses
never answer straight to the question ; and
when they arc cxamined for the prosecu-
lion, they answcr more than they are asked.
“They are never troubled about getting
eredit for what they say, but only about
showing off themselves by talking.’' This
is an excellent description of a sorward

show off himself (see c. 5).

turpijudieio] A trial in which an ad-
verse judgment brings ‘ infamia ' on the
defendant (Vol. II. Pro Quintio, c. 15).
As to Septimius and Lurco, see c. 35.
Cicero gives examples of Roman witnesses,
who would gladly have done all they could
against Flaccus, but they had some regard
for their character and for truth.

M. Caelium] We do not know who he
was3 but the context shows that he was a
Publicanus. He was proposed as a Recupe-
rator in a trial in which some other Publi-
canus was defendant, but as the defendant’s
case was manifestly bad, Caelius was struck
off the list of Recuperatores by the Praetor.
as a man who might be prejudiced in
favour of one who belonged to his own
order. Cicero is speaking ironically, when
he says that Caelius would have thought
it an aet osirreligion to have been a Recupe-
rator on the trial. Caelius would have had
no objection. but the praetor Flaccus would

explained this right.
