GAP. 4, 5. 77

pertimescendi3 sin illam alteram, nescio an amplius mihi negotii
contrahatur. Sed tamen meorum periculorum rationes utilitas rei
publicae vincat. Habemus enim a C. Caesare, sicut ipsius dignitas
et majorum ‘ejus amplitudo postulabat, sententiam tamquam obsi-
dem perpetuae in rem publicam voluntatis. Intellectum est quid
ζ interesset inter levitatem contionatorum et animum vere popularem,
saluti populi consulentem. Video de istis qui se populares haberi
volunt abesse non neminem, ne de capite videlicet civium Romano-
rum sententiam ferat. Is et nudiustertius in custodiam cives
Romanos dedit et supplicationem mihi decrevit et indices hesterno
die maximis praemiis affecit. Jam hoc nemini dubium est, qui reo
custodiam, quaesitori gratulationem, indici praemium decrevit, quid
de tota re et caussa judicarit. At vero C. Caesar intelligit legem
Semproniam esse de civibus Romanis constitutam3 qui autern rei

he would represent the senate and defend it
as a ‘ cognitor' acts for a manin a civil case
in his absence.

nescio an amplius] “I am inclined to
think that more trouble will be stored up
for me.'' This passage shows clearly that
‘nescio an’ is affirmative, or expresses the
inclination of the speaker's opinion towards
the affirmative.

non neminem,] Somebody, he does not
say who. The scholiasta Gronovianus tells
us: ‘Quintum Metellum dicit.y He means
Q. Metellus Nepos, who was tribunus pl. in
13.c. 62.—‘1s et nudiustertius:’ in Orelli's
second edition Halm has ¹⁴ sententiam ferat3
sed nudiustertius ;'' on the authority of one
MS.

yralulationem,] This word represents
‘ supplicationem :’ it means the honour that
was done to him by declaring the ‘ suppli-
catio! Cicero of course was not properly a
‘ quaesitor’ (see Vol. Ι. Verr. Act. l. c. 9)
on the occasion, nor was the affair before
the senate properly a Judicium; but the
application of both these words to the case
is justified by the likeness of Cicero to a
‘ quaesitor‚’ and by the likencss of the senate
toa‘judicium.’—‘decrevit:¹ ‘decrerit,' Halm.

leyem Semproniam] Caesar had spoken
of the ‘ Lex Porcia aliaeque ⁷ (Sallust, Cat.
c. 51). Cicero says: “ But in fact C. Caesar
knows that the Lex Sempronia was intended
to apply to citizens; and that if a man has
been declar-ed an enemy of the state. hc
cannot be a citizen.'’ Cicero adds that
C. Gracchus himself, who carried the ch
Sempronia, was put to death as an enemy
to the state, and by the sentence of the
people. The story of the death of C. Grac-
chus is told by Plutarch (C. Gracchus, c. 16,

17). The people did not protect him when
the Senate had empowered the consul Opi-
mius “to save the state in such way as he
could, and to put down the tyrants ” (Plu-
tarch, C. Gracchus, c. 14). Caius fied be-
fore his pursuers‚ and there was no man to
help him. ‘⁴ He just escaped into a sacred
grove of the Furies, and there he fell by the
hand of Philocrates, who killed himself on
the body of his master⁷’ (Plutarch). Dru-
mann, in his tedious way (Rom. Gesch. v.
p. 521), explains how Cicero could venture
to pervert the story. If we knew no more
of the matter than Cicero tells us here, we
should say that othe-Sempronia Lex (ue de

capite civium? Rgmjfflorum injussuwpsopuli

*judicaremffi only applied to citizens; that a

‘ffiffff'ffio''was declared an enemy to the
state could not claim the protection of the
Lem and that the man who proposed the
Lex was punished by the Populus (jussu
populi); from which we ought to conclude
that there was a formal condemnation. But
this was not so. Yet this misstatement of
Cicero is no ground for doubting the genu-
ineness of the oration. If we make errors
in fact or misstatements of facts an argu-
ment against the genuineness of Cicero's
works, we must condemn a great many pas-
sages. Nohody who has read the writer
without prejudice, and with a simple desire
to understand him, finds any difficulty in
understanding why under different circum-
stam-es he gives a different version of a
story. (See Vol. II. In Rullum, ii. e. 5,
note on the Gracchi.) Two critics have
proposed to alter ‘jussu' in this passage
into ‘injussus and Madvig has retained
this very absurd alteration even in the third
edition of his Select Orations, as Halm says.
