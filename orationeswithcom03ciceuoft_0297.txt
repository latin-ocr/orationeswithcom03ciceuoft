purgat se per epistolam, ut eam pecuniam quacum trajecerat non
consumpsisse sed Flacco dedisse videatur. XXXVII.—At fructus
isti Trallianorum Globulo praetore venierant: Falcidius emerat
H-S nongentis millibus—Si dat tantam pecuniam Flacco, nempe
idcirco dat ut rata sit emptio. Emit igitur aliquid quod certe
multo pluris esset: dat de lucro: nihil detrahit de vivo. Minus
igitur lueri facit. Cur Albanum venire jubet? cur matri praeterea
blanditur? cur epistolis et sororis et matris imbecillitatem aucupa-
tur? postremo cur non audimus ipsum? Retinetur, credo, in pro-
vincia: mater negat. Venisset,'inquit, si esset denuntiatum. Tu
certe coegisses, si ullum firmamentum in illo teste posuisses. Sed
hominem ab negotio abducere noluisti. Magnum erat ei certamen
propositum, magna cum Graecis contenti03 qui tamen, ut opinor,
jacent victi. Nam iste unus totam Asiam magnitudine poculorum
bibendoque superavit. Sed tamen quis tibi, Laeli, de epistolis istis
indicavit? Mulieres negant se scire. Quis is est igitur? Ille ipse
tibi se ad matrem et sororem scripsisse narravit? An etiam scrip-
sit oratu tuo? At vero M. Aebutium, constantissimum et puden-
tissimum hominem, Falcidii affinem, nihil interrogas? nihil ejus
generum, pari fide praeditum, C. Manilium? qui profecto de tanta
pecunia, si esset data, nihil audisse non posset. His tu igitur
epistolis, Deciane, recitatis, his mulierculis productis, illo absente
auctore laudato, tantum te crimen probaturum putasti ? praesertim,
quum ipse non deducendo Falcidium, judicium feceris plus falsam

quacum trajecerat] The money that he
had carried over with him. He had spent

thing which was worth much more ; that he
got his lease below its value. Accordingly

it, says Cicero. He wrote to tell his old
mother that he had given it to Flaccus.
The man had horrowed money from his
mother and his sister it seems, and perhaps
from others, to make a venture in Asia.
Money carried by sea was called Pecunia tra-
jectitia (Dio. 22. Tit. 2. De Nautico foenere).

37. AtJrztctus] This is a supposed an-
swer to Cicero. The other side says : The
man had not wasted the money3 hc had
farmed the ‘ vectigalia ⁷ of Tralles; he took
the lease in the time of Globulus, the prc-
decessor of Flaccu53 he gave for them nine
hundred thousand H-S. The expressions
‘ fructus’ and ⁴ emere ’ are explained in
Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 3. c. 6.

Cicero of course does not mean that Flac-
cus took money from Falcidius. But hc
says if Falcidius gave Flaccus so much. lic
did it that his farm might bc ratified ; and
it is a fair conclusion that he bought some-

Cicero concludes he made the present or
whatever it was to be called out of his pro-
fits, and not out of his capital (de vivo).
It was then merely a diminution of his
profits. Cicero continues, “Why does he
give orders for the sale of his estate at Alba ?
and why try to wheedle his poor mother
and sister-s out of their money ?’' The con-
clusion is that he wanted capital, that he
had wasted what he took with him, that he
had never taken to farm the ⁴ vectigalia ’ of
Tralles, and lastly that he never gave Flaccus
any thing.

If the prosecutor could not prove that
Flaccus had this money from Falcidius, there
was an end os that part of the charge. But
neither letters of Falcidius, 1101· the oatli of
Falcidius would prove that Flaccus had the
money.—‘ scire, quis z ipsc igitur ille,’
naiton—⁶ 11011 possm-ff 831¹. A.; ‘non pos-
sent,’ Baiter.
