CAP. 3, 4. 57

tulo se habere ad Catilinam mandata et litteras, ut servorum
praesidio uteretur et ad urbem quam primum cum exercitu acce-
deret:, id autem eo consilio, ut, quum urbem ex omnibus partibus
quemadmodum descriptum distributumque erat incendissent, cae-
demque infinitam civium fecissent, praesto esset ille qui et fugientes
exciperet, et se cum his urbanis ducibus conjungeret. Introducti
autem Galli jusjurandum sibi et litteras ab Lentulo, CethegO, Sta-
tilio ad suam gentem datas esse dixerunt, atque ita sibi ab his et a
L. Cassio esse praescriptum, ut equitatum in Italiam quam primum
mitterent; pedestres sibi copias non defuturas; Lentulum autem
sibi confirmasse ex fatis Sibyllinis haruspicumque responsis se esse
tertium illum Cornelium ad quem regnum hujus urbis atque impe-
rium pervenire esset necesse; Cinnam ante se et Sullam fuisse;
eundemque dixisse fatalem hunc annum esse ad interitum hujus
urbis atque imperii, qui esset annus decimus post virginum absolu-

Klotz's explanation:

 

Est genus unum
stultitiae nihilum metuenda timentis.''

descriptum distributumque] I have no
doubt that it should be ‘discriptum,'
⁴ marked out.’ ⁴ Descriptum ' is a different
thing. But no various reading is noticed in
this passage. When any form of ¹ descri-
bere' occurs, it is very unusual to find any
various reading given. Yet we might expect
to find various forms of ‘discribere,’ even
when the word ought to be some form of
‘describere' In the inscription of Vena-
frum (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 3. c. 30) the form
‘discribere’ occurs, and it is the proper
word there.

Sallust (Cat. c. 43) and Plutarch (Cicero,
e. 18) say something on the desigu of the
con-pirators about burning the city: ‘¹ Ac-
cordingly Lentulus designed nothing small
or trivial, but he determined ω kill all the
senators, and as many of the rest of the
citizens as he could, and to burn the city,
and spare nobody except the children of
Pompeius, whom they intended to seize and
keep in their power as securities for coming
‘to terme with Pompeius, sor already there
was strong and sure report of his returning
to Rome from his great expedition.”

Introducti—Gatli] Sallust, Cat. c. 47:
‘ Eadem Galli fatentur.’ as Vulturcius. They
said the same thing about the Libri Sibyl-
lini. these mysterious books. which one of
the Tarquinii, Priscus or Superbus, bought
from the wise woman (Dionys. Hal. iv. 62).
They were kept in Jupiter's temple on the

Capitol. The books were destroyed ηε.
83, ἰη the consulship of L. Cornelius Scipio
and C. Norbanus, when the Capitol was
burnt (Appiam B. C. i. 8:5; Tacit. Hist.
iii. 72) ; but they were soon restored. The
Romans let nothing ancient perish. The
Capitol was burnt again in the time of
Vitellius (Tacit. Hist. iii. 72). Halm quotes
a passage of Tacitus (Hist. iv. 54), which is
instructive The Galli were in rebellion:
‘¹ Sed nihil aeque quam incendium Capitolii
ut finem imperio adesse crederent impulerat.
Captam olim a Gallis urbem: sed integra
Jovis sede man-*isse imperium. Fatali nunc
igne signum caelestis irae datum, et posses-
sionem rerum humanarum Transalpinis gen-
tibus portendi superstitione vana Druidae
canebant.’' The destiny of a nation may in
popular opinion hang on a trifle; on a
building. on a town, on a form, on a shadOW.
The Druids knew the destiny of Rome bet-
ter than Tacitus.

datas esse] ‘data esse‚' Halm, on the
authority of two MSS. A little further on
he reads ‘ erant deprehensa,’ for which there
is better authority than for the reading
⁴ erant deprehensae.'

post viminum] The Vestals, who were
often called The virgins. Sometimes the
singular is used:

 

dum Capitolium
Scandet cum tacita virgine P‹›ntifex.’'
(Hor. Carni. iii. 30.)

Nothing is< known of this affair, but Halm
supposes that it is alluded to in the Brutus
(c. 67). Sometimes the holy virgins broke
their vow of chastity; and au Rome trem-
