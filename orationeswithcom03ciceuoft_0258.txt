244 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

ut eos qui domo exire nolebant testimonii denuntiatione terreret:
qui domi stare non poterant, largo et liberali viatico commoveret.
Sic adolescens ingenii plenus locupletes metU, tenues praemio,
stultos errore permovit: sic sunt expressa ista praeclara quae reci-
tantur psephismata, non sententiis, neque auctoritatibus declarata,
nec jurejurando constricta, sed porrigenda manu profundendoque
clamore multitudinis concitatae.

VII. Ο morem praeclarum disciplinamque, quam a majoribus
accepimus, si quidem teneremus; sed nescio quo pacto jam de
manibus elabitur. Nullam enim illi nostri sapientissimi et sanc-
tissimi viri vim contionis esse voluerunt. Quae scisceret plebes,
aut quae populus juberet, summota contione, distributis partibus,
tributim et centuriatim, descriptis ordinibus, classibus, aetatibus,
auditis auctoribus, re multos dies promulgata et cognita, juberi
vetarique voluerunt. Graecorum autem totae res publicae sedentis
contionis temeritate administrantur. Itaque, ut hanc Graeciam,
quae jamdiu suis consiliis perculsa et afflicta est, omittam, illa

tite, and it is improved by eating at an-
other’s cost.

psephismata‚] The resolutions of the
Greek towns which are afterwards men-
tioned. They were carried by χειροτονία,
by a show of hands of an excitable crowd.
Cicero dexterously throws discredit on all
the evidence that was got against Flaccus.
It was no evidence indeed, being merely
the assent of a noisy crowd to something
which scmebody proposed3 for evidence
must be the declaration of definite persons.
It wanted also the confirmation of the oath.
The end of this sentence is very difficult to
translate. Indeed what is so difficult to
translate as the Latin language? There
are two participles, ⁴ declarata' and ‘ con-
stricta’ for the first members of the sen-
tence, but none for the last, unless we sup-
ply ¹ declarata,y “ by the outstretched hands
and tumultuous shouts of an excited multi-
tude.”

7. Quae scisceret plebes,] He is alluding
to a Plebiscituxn, aud to a Lex (quae popu-
lus juberet). The Romans had no voting
by show of hands: no measure could be
carried by the violence of a popular assem-
bly (contio). The Romans had often vio-
lent scenes at their elections and 011 other
occasions, but the legal form of expressing
the popular will was quiet and regular.
The people were removed out of tho way
(summota contione), their several plat-cs
were assigned to them. If we were to at-
tempt to explain what follows by a state-

ment of the Roman method of voting,
which does not at all concern the general
understanding of the passage, we might
find some difficulty. Cicero heaps words
on words, and might be intelligible enough
to a Roman; but if we were to give this
passage a precise interpretation, we should
be doing what the orator never intended.
At the end he is clearer; after the pro-
posers and supporters of the Lex (auctores)
have addressed the people; after the Ro-
gatio or intended Lex has been put up in
public for many days, and every body knew
what the thing was, the people by their
votes accepted or rejected the Lex.

Cicero mentions the ⁸ contiones ’ (ἑκκλ η-
σίαι) of the Greeks as sitting. As the
Greeks met in the theatre where there were
scats, there was nothing strange in their
sitting down3 and as Klotz acutely re-
marks, the sitting was of itself quite an
innocent thing. Itis more to the purpose
what Cicero says shortly after, that the po·
pular assemblies of Athens were the ruin of
the state. The Senate saved the Roman
state, not by its virtue, nor by its wisdom,
though a Roman senate was certainly wiser
than an Athenian people, but by the supe-
rior prudence or perhaps only cantion of a
smaller number who feel that their own
preservation often consists in resisting the
popular opinion.

juberi velarique] Bake (Cicero, De Leg.
iii. 3) proposes to read ‘juberi vetari voluc-
runt ;’ and lie may be right.
