ORAT. DE DOMO SUA.

.
fiees, ut me, quem auctoritate, studio, sententiis restituistis, nunc,
quoniam senatus ita vult, manibus quoque vestris in sedibus meis

collocetis,

not easy to see what ⁴ manibus ' means, but
Manutius says on ‘ inanibus,’ ‘⁴ quod antea
sententiis fecistis ;'’ and that is the author's
meaning. He will have antithesis, and he
cares not for truth. Having said ‘sen-
tentiis‚' which is false, he adds ⁴ manibus ¹
to balance it; which is false too. For I
assume that the Pontifices would not place
him with their hands either in his house,
which no longer existed, or on the ground.

It is usual for a man to take possession
himself; nor does he want any help for
that, unless he meets with resistance (De
Harusp. c. 8).

He has said this before about the ‘ sen-
tentiis ’ (c. 37) with no ⁴ manibus ’ and some
variatiou. In c. 37 it is ⁸ in meis aedibus.'
Here it is ‘ in meis sedibus.' These two

forms are continually interchanged or con-
founded in the MSS.
