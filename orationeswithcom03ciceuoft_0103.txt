INTRODUCTION

To THE

ORATION FOR L. MURENA.

IN the consular comitia for B.c. 63 the candidates were L. Catilina,
Servius Sulpicius, L. Licinius Murena, and D. J unius Silanus. Murena
and Silanus were elected. Catilina tried to avenge himself by hurrying
on the execution of his conspiracy (Introduction to the Four Orations
against Catilina). Servius commenced a prosecution against hsurena
for having used bribery (ambitus) at his election. Murena was prose-
cuted under the Lex Tullia in the month of November, Rc. 63, or
between the eighth of November and the fifth of December (c. 2, 3,
and the notes). Servius was assisted by M. Cato, Cn. Postumius, and
his sou Servius. Plutarch (Cato, c. 213 Cicero, c. 35) says that Cato
was the prosecutor, and so he might call him, but he only helped Servius.
He was what the Romans call ‘subscript0r.’ Cato took great pains
about collecting evidence against Murena: “ ‘When Cato was prosecuting
MTurena for bribery and collecting the evidence, he was attended ac-
cording to custom by those who had to watch what he did. Now these
men would often ask him, whether he intended to collect any thing that
day or to do any thing relating to the prosecution3 and if he said No,
they would trust him and go away” (Plutarch: Πῶς ἂν τὶς ὑπ’ ἐχθρῶν
ὼφελοῒτο; c. 9). Plutarch has the same story at greater length in his life
(c. 21).

Cicero, Q. Hortensius, and M. Crassus defended Murena, and he was
acquitted. Cicero spoke last (c. 23). He mentions this trial and his
defence in several passages (Pro Flacco, c. 393 De Finibus, iv. 27).

If Murena was guilty, Cicero had a difficult task in defending him3
and even if he was innocent, it was not an easy thing to defend Murena
against the attacks of two honest men, who, we may assume, believed
him to be guilty. Quintilian (Inst. xi. 1) admires the skill of Cicero:
“ Duae simul hujusmodi personae Ciceroni pro Murena dicenti obstite-
runt, M. Catonis Serviique Sulpicii: quam decenter tamen Sulpicio,
