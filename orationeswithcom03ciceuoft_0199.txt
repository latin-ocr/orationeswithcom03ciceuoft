The Romans had more whims iu their
wills than we have. A testator could im-
pose certain duties 011 his heres or heredes,
such as the erection of a monument, the
exhibition of gladiators, and the giving of
a public entertainment. He could effect
most of such objects by the form of a con-
dition. Livy (28, c. 21) describes the
games which Scipio exhibited in Spain at
Carthago Nova: “Scipio Carthaginem ad
vota solvenda munusque gladiatorium, quod
mortis caussa patris patruique paraverat,
edendum rediit.”

Arrepta est] Another charge: a whole
familia of gladiators was eagerly bought up
by Sulla. If he had let this opportunity
pass, another might have served for Faus-
tus' purpose. The eagerness of Sulla in
the purchase is made a presumption of his
guilt. The prosecution afterwards says,
‘ Properatum vehementer est,' which is only
a further explanation of ‘ arrepta est fami-
lia)

Cicero replies, ¹ Utinam quidem haec
ipsa,' the meaning of which is not quite
plain. ‘ Haec ipsa ' is the ‘ familia ' which
Sulla did buy. Faustus was an object of
envy for his wealth which his father got by
foul means As Faustus was rich, the peo-
ple would expect a grand show, and Cicero
means to say that the number of gladiators
purchased was not large. No exhibition
could satisfy the envy of those who did not
like Faustus: Cicero says that he only
hoped it might satisfy the expectations of
reasonable people. This is a way of saying
that the number of gladiators bought by
Sulla furnished no presumption that he had
any bad design. These gladiators were not
exhibited until 13.c. 60 (Dion 37, c. 51),
when Sulla also feasted the people in great
style, and opened the bat-hs gratis to them,
and gave every man an allowance of oil.

But there is a difficulty here, which I

have not seen aremark 011. Cicero says he
wishes this very body of gladiators had
satisfied expectation (satisfacere posset).
He speaks of the exhibition as past. But
it is concluded that this oration was deli-
vered in B.c. 62. The ground of this con-
clusion of Manutius is the words in c. 30,
⁴¹ cujus nuper ferrum rettuderim flammam-
que restinxerim ;’' but the conclusion from
‘nuper ’ cannot be admitted. A more pro-
bable conclusion is derived from the words
in c. 33,· ‘⁶ quae per hos meuses in homines
audacissimos facta sunt.’'

litterae] Faustus was with Pompeius in
Asia in 13.c. 63. He distinguished himself
at the storming of Jerusalem by being the
first man to scale the walls of the temple,
for which he was well rewarded. Sulla,
like his father, had an eye to profit. He
was greedy of money, and 110 squandered it
too.

L. Caesarem‚] He was one of the con-
suls of the year Β.0. 64 (In Cat. iv. c. 6).
This Pompeius Rufus was a grandson of
the dictator Sulla, a son of Sulla's daughter
Cornelia. C. Memmius was the husband
of Fausta, who was the sister of Faustus.
Memmius put her away, and she married
T. Annius Milo, and committed adultery
with the historian C. Sallustius, as it is
said.

praefuitfamiliae] He looked after the
gladiators and their training. Halm omits
Cornelius, as Lambinus suggests, though it
is in the MSS. Sulla is meant. Orelli
would not erase Cornelius, and he thinks
that it is absurd to suppose that Sulla is
meant. Cornelius he sayS, is neither Sulla,
nor C. Cornelius, the Roman eques, one of
Torquatus’ witnesses, but some freedman
of P. Sulla, named in the evidence. He
adds: “ Probabiliter post v. Cornelius exci-
dit P. L. Publii libertus, ut saepe notis
accidit.”
