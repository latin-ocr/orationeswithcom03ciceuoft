374 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA
illius miseri caussam pertinere. Haec homines improbi ad quosdam
viros fortes longe aliter atque a me dicta erant detulerunt. Hora
nona illo ipso die tu es adoptatus. Si quod in ceteris legibus trinum
nundinum esse oportet, id in adoptione satis est trium esse hora-
rum, nihil reprehendo. Sin eadem observanda sunt, si decrevit
senatus M. Drusi legibus, quae contra legem Caeciliam et Didiam
latae essent, populum non teneri, jam intelligis omni genere juris,
quod in sacris, quod in auspiciis, quod in legibus sit, te tribunum
plebis non fuisse. At ego hoc totum non sine caussa relinquo.
Video enim quosdam clarissimos viros, principes civitatis, aliquot
’ locis judicasse te cum plebe jure agere p0t11isse; qui etiam de me
ipso, quum tua rogatione funere elatam rem publicam esse dicerent,
tamen id funus, etsi miserum atque acerbum fuisset, jure indictum
esse dicebant. Quod de me civi ac de re publica bene merito
tulisses, funus te indixisse rei publicae, quod salvis auspiciis
tulisses, jure egisse dicebant. Quare licebit, ut opinor, nobis eas
actiones non infirmare, quibus illi actionibus constitutum tribunatum

comprobaverunt.

F ueris sane tribunus plebis tam jure legeque quam fuit hic ipse

16. ad quosdam viros] “Cicerone in
judicio quodam deplorante temporum sta-
tum, P. Clodium inimicum ejus frustra jam-
pridem a patribus ad plebem transire niten-
tem eodem die horaque nona transduxit’'
(Sueten. Julius, c. 20).

trinum nundinum] The ‘promulgatio
trinum nundinum' (Cic. Phil. v. 3) was
established by a Lex Caecilia and Didia,
13.c. 98. According to this Lex a Rogatio
must be pmmulgated, put up in public,
three ‘nundinae ’ before the voting day.

Baiter writes “observanda sunt, judi-
cavit (C.) senatus . . . populum non teneri.
Jam intelligis.” Klotz has the same, and
he maintains that the ‘si ’ before ‘judica-
vit' or ‘decrevit’ should be omitted, and
that ‘jam' should begin a new sentence.
Drusus was a tr. pl. of B.c. 91. Here we
have an example of the Senate acting as a
supreme court and declaring that certain
Leges were invalid for want of the proper
forms being observed in their enactment.

The notice of the ‘ trinum nundinum ’
was required in the matter of an ‘adroga-
tio ' as well as in any other Lex, as Dion
(39. c. ll) tells us. Wolf thinks that the
passage in Dion is singular, whether he got
it from this declamation or from a genuine
oration of Cicer0; for, he says, who can
suppose that Cicero found fault with nothing
in that Lex Curiata except the neglect of

the ‘trinum nundinum ?' To this we may
answer that if Dion says no more, that does
not prove that he found no more in his
authorities. Wolf concludes that Dion, as
on many other occasions, derived his facts
with no great accuracy from sources not
the best. The remark about Dion is true.
Other good judges have understood him
well, Casaubon for instance. This compilet·
has of late been wonderfully overrated.

qm· etiam de me, &c.] There is a passage
in the oration De Provin. Cons. e. 19, from
which this is taken: “Itaque vir summa
auctoritate, summa eloquentia, dixit gra-
viter casum illum meum funus esse rei pub-
licae, sed funus justum et indictum.’' A
comparison of the two will show how the
Declamator worked up his material. He
loves to multiply words and persons. Here
it is ‘clarissimi viri,' as he said ‘quosdam
viros fortes ¹ just above, where he intended
to refer to Caesar. “ Amat iste pluralem
numerum, in quo plus gravitatis est, inter-
dum etiam plus sapientiae ’⁷ (Wolf).—
‘Quare licebit,' &e.: wherefore we may
allow those enactments to be valid‚ the
Leges of Caesar, and the tribuneship of
Clodius among them.

tam juo-e leyeqne] ‘Tam in jure quam
lege, P. V.‚' Baiter with a †; who ob-
serves that Car. Stephanus has ‘tam jure
legeque‚' which I suppose that C. Ste-
