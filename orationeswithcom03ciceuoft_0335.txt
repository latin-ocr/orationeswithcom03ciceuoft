Nostra memoria senatores ne in suis quidem periculis

mutare vestem solebant : in meo periculo senatus veste mutata fuit,
quoad licuit per eorum edicta, qui mea pericula non modo suo prae-
sidio sed etiam vestra deprecatione nudarunt.

Quibus ego rebus objectis, quum mihi privato confligendum
viderem cum eodem exercitu quem consul non armis, sed vestra

auctoritate superaram, multa mecum ipse reputavi.

senatores ne in suis] Markland affirms
this to be false, for he can collect examples
of other senators in Cicero’s time, who had
changed their dress, Murena for instance,
and P. Sulla (Pro Murena, c. 4ος Pro
Sulla, c. 31). It seems that Markland
understood the text in the plain sense,
“that within Cicero's memory senators were
not accustomed to change their dress even
when they were in difficulties themselves ;”
and so one would suppose that the text
ought to be understood. Gesner answers
Markland by giving this new interpretation
to the words: “there were some who did
not change their dress.” But the words
are too strong for Gesner ; and the assertion
in the text is false.

13. Nnminatz'm alii] Cicero in the ora-
tion Pro Sestio (c. 15—22) tells the story
of his going into exile at length. He says
there ‘ Gradus templi (Castoris) tolleban-
tur,’ which is simply said. Here it is orna-
mented, ‘ demolitione sublati.' Clodius took
away the steps of the temple of Castor after
filling it with armed men (In Pison. c. 10).

Alter consul] The common reading in
the editions is ‘Alter consules ut me . . .
pactionibus eos suorum‚' &c. Halm says,
‘ consul mei et Lagg. :' ‘ consules ' is a con-
jecture. Halm writes ‘ se ⁷ in place of ¹ eos)
the MSS. reading. The consul ‘qui dixe-
rat ’ is Gabinius z the ‘ alter consul ’ is Piso.
But though we may see that there is an
allusion to the bargain with Clodius by
which the consuls got their provinces, the
sentence is corrupt.

alius· ad portas] This is Caesar, who had
'got his province for five years. He was
outside of Rome with a great army, four

legions, as Klotz says, who remarks on the
dexterous way in which our orator shows
his relation to Caesar. Caesar says that he
crossed the Alps to the Lake of Geneva to
oppose the Helvetii, but he does not say
what force he had with him. He found one
legion only in Gallia Transalpina, and he
recrossed the Alps to Aquileia to get three
legions which had wintered there (B. G. i.
7. 8. lo), and to raise two more in Gallia
Cisalpina. He led these five legions over
the Alps to reinforce the troops near Ge-
neva, the one legion which then was in the
Provincia, and the troops that had been
raised there after his first arrival. His own
narrative proves that he took no troops from
Rome, that he had no army before the gates3
and the writer of this declamation shows
great ignoranee by placing Caesar at the gates
of Rome with a large army. In the oration
Pro Sestio, ec. 17, 18, we have the truth:
“ Ipse autem Caesar, quem maxime ho-
mines ignari veritatis mihi esse iratum pu-
tabant, erat ad portas, erat cum imperio,
erat in Italia ejus exercitus, inque eo ex-
ercitu ipsius tribuni pl. inimici mei fratrem
praefecerat.⁷’ He says that Caesar was at
the gates. He does not say that his army
was; but it was in Italia, which means not
at Rome. Dion Cassius (38. e. 17) says that
Caesar was outside the city : ὁ μέντοι Καῖ-
σαρ, ἔξω γὰρ τοῦ τείχους ὁ Κλώδιος δι’
αὐτὸν, ἐπειδήπερ {gearwa-evm, τὸν ὅμι-
λον συναγαγών, &‹·.: but he does not say
what the Latin translation of Reimarus
makes him say: “Jam Caesar milites ex—
tra urbem 111 expeditione hahebat.'¹ Manu-
tius says that he was at the gates with four
legions with which he marched to the Gallie
