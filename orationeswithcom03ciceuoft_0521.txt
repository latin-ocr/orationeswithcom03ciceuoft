CAP. 22, 23. 507

profugisset, primo senile corpus paludibus occultasse demersum, de-
inde ad infimorum ac tenuissimorum hominum Minturnis misericor-
diam confugisse, inde navigio perparvo, quum omnes port-us terrasque
fugeret, in oras Africae desertissimas pervenisse. Atque ille vitam
suam, ne inultus esset, ad incertissimam spem et ad rei publicae
fatum reservavit: ego, qui, quemadmodum multi in senatu me
absente dixerunt, periculo rei publicae vivebam, quique ob eam caus-
sam consularibus litteris de senatus sententia exteris nationibus
commendabar, nonne, si meam vit-am deseruissem, rem publicam
prodidissem? in qua quidem nunc me restituto vivit mecum simul
exemplum fidei publicae. Quod si immortale retinetur, quis non
intelligit immortalem hanc civitatem futuram?

XXIII. Nam externa bella regum, gentium, nationum jam pri-
dem ita exstincta sunt, ut praeclare cum iis agamus quos pacatos
esse patiamur. Denique ex bellica vict-oria non fere quemquam est
invidia civium consecuta. Domesticis malis et audacium civium
consiliis saepe est resistendum eorumque periculorum est in re

Minturnis] Mueller observes that Cicero
tells this story almost in the same words in
the De Pin. ii. 323 Pro Plancio, c. 10 ; 111
Pison. c. 19. But it is told in a very dif-
ferent way in the Quum Populo, c. 8, and
the notes.

Wesenberg observes that if ‘ Minturnis '
is right, it means ¹ men of Minturnae ;’ and
119 cites the Pro Cluentio, c. 13: “Fuit
Avillius quidam Larino‚'' but there is also a
reading ‘Larinas’ So we have in Caesar
(B. G. iii. 20) : “viris fortibus Tolosa, Car-
casone et Narbone,’' which means ‘ men of
Tolosa.’ There is also the authority of in-
scriptions for this form of expression.

KVesenberg remarks that those to whose
compassion Marius is said tvo have fied,
came (pervenerunt) to Marius when he was
sunk in the marshes, took him out, and put
him in a vessel, and he refers to the Quum
Populo, e. 8; Livy, Ep. 77 ; Schol. Vat.
Ad pincianam, ξ 26. Η9 is inclined to
take Passeratius’ emendation of ¹ Mintur-
nensium ' for ‘Minturnis.' But ‘ Minturnis'
may mean ‘ at Minturnae‚’ as Seyffert sug-
gests. who connects it with ⁴ confugisse‚'
but in that case it ought to be ⁴ Minturnas,’
which would be a small alteration.

salum] A conjecture of Pantagathus :
P. G. have ‘ratum,' G. ‘raptum ’ corr. m. 2.
Garatoni proposed ⁴ ad alium rei publicae
statum! Bake explains ‘fatum ' to mean
that the return of Marius was attended with
the slaughter and proscription of the ‘boni.'

Cicero h'ved ‘periculo rei publicae‚’ at the
hazard of the state, for on his life depended
the safetv of the state. Α

consularibus litteris] Written by P. Len-
tulus consul, Pro Plancio, c. 323 In Pison.
c. 15; and this oration, c. 60 (Garatoni
secundum Ferratium).

e-remplum fidei publicae] Halm has
several times cited the German version of
Osiander‚ who seems to have a talent for
misunderstanding his author: “ es lebt mit
mir ein Beispiel der Treue gegen den Staat ;·''
‘¹ there lives with me an example of fidelity
to the state ;‘’ whereas, as Halm says. it.
means that ‘⁴ as Ι have been restored, there
lives together with myself an example of
public integrity or good faith;¹’ which would
be au encouragement to others to serve
their country well.

23. Nam externa bella] Halm compares
In Cat. ii. 5, and De Lege Agrar. i. 9:
“multa sunt occulta rei publicae wilnera,
multa nefariorum civium perniciosa con-
silia: nullum externum periculum est, non
rex, non gens ulla, non natio, pertimescenda
est.’' Even the formidable Galli were hum-
bled. Caesar was now in the third year of
his victorious career in Gallia—⁸ praeclare
cum iis agamus? ‘we treat them well, if
we allow them to be quiet 3’ he means
they were so completely beaten that they
must be content if they are left quiet.
Comp. Verr. ii. 3. e. 50: ‘⁴ intelliget secum
esse actum pessiine.'’
