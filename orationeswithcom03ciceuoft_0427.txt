OAP. 45, 46. 413

similem, cui res publica non tantum debeat, per vim afflixerit,
domum ejus per pontificem dedicaverit, id vos ista auctoritate con-
stituetis ratum esse oportere? Dicis, quem reppererit pontificem?
Quid, et tribunus plebis idem esse non potest pontifex? M. Dru-
sus, ille clarissimus vir, tribunus plebis pontifex fuit. Ergo, si is
Q. Caepionis inimici sui postem aedium tenuisset et pauca verba
fecisset, aedes Caepionis essent dedicatae? Nihil loquor de pon-
tificio jure, nihil de ipsius verbis dedicationis, nihil de religione,
caerimoniis: non dissimulo me nescire ea quae etiamsi scirem dis-
simularem, ne aliis molestus, vobis etiarn curiosus viderer-3 etsi
effluunt multa ex vestra disciplina, quae etiam ad nostras aures
saepe permanant. Postem teneri in dedicatione oportere videor
audisse templi : ibi enim postis est, ubi templi aditus est [valvae].
Ambulationis postes nemo umquam tenuit in dedicando: simu-

 

could be a pontifex. He says that M. Li-
vius Drusus was a pontifex. Q. Servilius
Caepio was the brother-in-law of Drusus,
and his enemy. Klotz says: ‘⁶ Wolf has not
understood this passage, like many other
passages.” And he then tells us that Cicero,
who is speaking of the great danger to the
state if Clodius’ proceedings were ratified‚
supposes it might happen that the same
man might be pontifex and tribune, from
which would result a union of power in one
person which might with impunity attack
any man’s property and dedicate it. He
concludes, ‘⁴ consequently the orator in no
respect contradicts himself.'’ This is Wolf's
note: “Hoc si verum est, Clodius fortasse
plus etiam fecit, quam postulari poterat,
quandoquidem Pontificem tamen adhibuit (c.
47). Ita ipse scriptor sua vineta caedit non-
nunquam.'’ I leave the reader to form his
own conclusion about Wolf not understand-
ing the passage, and about the commentator
who charges him with it.

Postem teneri] Markland ridicules this,
‘videor audisse;' as if every boy in Rome
did not know it, for the dedication of a
temple was a public ceremony. Gesner
defends the form in which Cicero professes
his ignorance of Pontifical Law3 and he
refers to the passage in the Verrine orations
(Vol. Ι. ii. 4. c. 3, note) in which Cicero
pretends to know nothing of Greek art, as
in the oration for Murena, c. 30, he makes
a kind of excuse for having studied philo-
sophy in his youth. After this and other
matters he adds, ‘⁴ this passage is very appro-
priate and worthy of Tullius' judgment, if
any is'’ (see c. 54). Wolf adds this to the
remarks of Gesner and Markland ε “ Semel

professus sum, contrarias animadversiones
me allaturum omnes: sed non ubique ne-
cesse habeo aliquid subnotare. Pro suo
quisque captu interpretetur silentium nos-
trum.⁷’

aditus est] If ⁴ valvae’ must be retained,
and Ι suppose that it is in all the MSS„ wc
must write ⁴ aditus et valvae,' as it is gene-
rally printed. Markland finds fault with
‘ ibi enim‚’ and he asks what ‘ enim ' means
in this wretched sentence. He thinks it
has no use at all. Gesner explains it. He
says that the ‘ rationalis particula ' presents
the reason why the Pontifex lays hold of
the door-post in the ceremony of dedication.
The laying hold of the door-post was a tra—
dition or delivery to the god of his own
house. This souuds well, but it is pure
nonsense, for a ‘traditio ' or delivery is not
effected without a man to accept. The god
should have taken hold of the door-post, or
taken the key from the Pontiff and let. him-
self into his house. Gesner refers to the
dedication by Horatius Pulvillus (Livy, ii.
c. 8) who “tenens postem precationem per-
agit, et dedicat.’' The man who performed
the ceremony of dedication must show in
some way what the thing is which he is
going to dedicate, and to lay hold of the
door-post would do as well as to touch any
other part. But what has all this trifling
to do with the matter? and the remark
about an ‘ambulatio ’ or ‘porticus,’ which
has no ‘postis?' If there is any sense in
the passage, the Declamator means to say
that the Pontifex held the ‘postes ambula-
tionis.’ But Ι leave to others to find out,
if they can, what the writer means.
