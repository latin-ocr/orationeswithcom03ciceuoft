INTRODUGTION. 295

Cicero's recall, but the measure was resisted by the consuls L. Piso and
A. Gabinius, notwithstanding it was supported by Pompeius, whom
Clodius had roused by his personal attacks. The tribune Aelius Staienus
opposed the proposal of Ninnius (Pro Sestio, c. 31, 32), and Clodius
was still in office and powerful. The Senate frequently pressed the
matter, but they could do nothing (Ad Att. iii. 153 In Pisonem, c.
13). In November of the same year P. Lentulus Spinther, one of the
‘ consules designati,’ made another unsuccessful attempt to recall Cicer03
and Cicero’s friend P. Sestius even went to Caesar in Gallia to solicit
his favour, but we do not know what he got by his journey (Pro Sestio,
c. 323 Ad Att. iii. 20 and 23).

On the lst of J anuary of the next year, ac. 57, the consul Lentulus,
who had now entered on his duties, proposed a resolution of the Senate
for Cicero’s recall, his colleague Metellus making no opposition3 and it
would have been carried, if the tr. pl. Atilius had not prevailed on the
Senate to adjourn the business (Pro Sestio, c. 34). A few days before
the end of the month of J anuary (the 25th) a Rogatio was proposed for
the recall of Cicero, but the business of the day was disturbed by a
bloody riot. The enemies of Cicero occupied the Forum, the Comi-
tium, and the Curia, the night before with armed men, and attacked
the tribune Q. Fabricius who had proposed the Rogatio with the
consent of seven other ‘tribuni.’ P. Sestius and Cicero's brother
Quintus were wounded (Pro Sestio, c. 353 Pro Milone, c. 143 Dion
Cassius, 39. c. 7). Men were cut down in the Forum, the Tiber was
filled with dead bodies, the sewers were choaked, and the blood was
wiped up from the Forum with sponges. Such is the frightful picture,
perhaps somewhat exaggerated‚ which Cicero draws of this terrible com-
motion.

Several Senatusconsulta were passed in favour of Cicero, but it is
immaterial to examine whether there were three or five, as some suppose
(Pro Sestio, c. 54, 603 Pro Plancio, c. 323 De Prov. Cons. c. 9).
Finally pursuant to a Senatusconsultum a Rogatio was proposed to
the people in the Comitia Centuriata and carried on the 41:11 of August,
B.c. 57, by all the Centuriae. The people came from all parts of Italy
to vote for the Rogati03 and the Campus Martius was crowded with
men (Ad Att. iii. 26; In Pison. c. 153 Pro Milone, c. 15).

Cicero who had long and anxiously been expecting this successful
result, had moved from Thessalonica to Dyrrachium. He left Dyrra-
chium on the day on which the Rogatio was carried, and he arrived at
Brundisium the next day. His daughter Tullia was waiting for him,
and he wasjoyfully received by the people of Brundisium. His journey
to Rome was like a triumpha] procession. Hc was niet outsidc the
walls by a crowd of his fellow-citizens who conducted him to the Capitol
