num? At is quidem omnem suam de nobis potestatem tradidit
vobis. Quamobrem, nisi hoc loco, nisi apud vos, nisi per vos,
judices, non auctoritatem quae amissa est, sed salutem nostram,
quae spe exigua extremaque pendet, tenuerimus, nihil cst praeterea
quo confugere possimus, nisi forte, quae res hoc judicio tentetur,
quid agatur, cui caussae fundamenta jaciantur, judices, non videtis.
Condemnatus est is qui Catilinam signa patriae inferentem interemit ;
quid est caussae cur non is qui Catilinam ex urbe reppulit perti-
mescat? Repetitur ad poenam qui indicia communis exitii cepit;
cur sibi confidat is qui ea proferenda et patefacienda curavit?
Socii consiliorum, ministri, comitesque vexantur; quid auctores,
quid duces, quid principes sibi exspectent? Atque utinam inimici
nostri ac bonorum omnium mecum potius contendant utrum tum

omnes boni duces nostri an comites fuerint ad communem conser-
vandam salutem * *ς

reppulit] ‘ Expulit‚' Pantagathus, Baiter.
Manutius says that ‘ cur non is ’ is Flaccus
who drove back Catilina by depriving him

But Antonius is not alluded to herc. Flaccus
took (cepit) the letters of the conspirators
from the Allobroges. ‘Cur sibi confidat

of the help of the conspirators in Rome.
But ⁸ reppulit ' refers to Cicero. Antonius,
who had the command of the army against
Catilina, had been condemned. He did not
destroy Catilina however, for he was ill on
the day of the battle. But Cicero says that
he did. If my colleague has been condemned,
who destroyed Catilina, why should not he
be afraid who drove him from the city?
This is clearly Cicero himself.

The inan who was condemned was C.
Antonius, Cicero's colleague, who was go-
vernor of Macedonia after his consulship.
Ile was prosecuted, B.c. 59, by M. Caelius
Rufus (Pro Caelio, e. 31), and defended by
Cicero. He was convictcd and retired to
Cephallenia. Some modern writers attempt
to show that he was twice prosecuted ; but
this seems to be a niistake. Hc was con-
victcd, as it appears, of Repetundae. The
matter is examined by Rcin (Das Riimische
Criminalrecht, p. 660).

Repetitur] There is a reading ‘ rapitur,’
and Manutius applies it to C. Antonius.

is ' is Cicero himself, who as consul directed
the examination of the conspirators and of
the witnesses against them. Cicero has
just compared himself with his colleague
Antonius3 and now he compares himself
with Flaccus. He already felt his danger.
Manutius 1135 misunderstood the whole pas-
sage. The Scholiast understood it. Again,
Cicero speaks of ⁴ socii consiliorum, minis-
tri, c‹›mites,’ who are harassed; and if
those who shared the counsels, who served
and made themselves associates‚ 310 ha-
rassed, what may the ‘auctorcs‚ duces,
principcs,’ expect? Here the ‘socii’ are
Flaccus, the ‘auctores' arc himself. Hc
com-ludes by inviting his cnemies to try a
struggle with himself, which makes all
plain; if it wanted making plainer. llis
enemics soon accepted the challenge (sec
the Introduction to the orations, Oratio
quum Senatui gratias egit, ἃς).

potius contendant ulrmn] There is some-
thing wrong here.
