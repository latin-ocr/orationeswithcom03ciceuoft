188 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

patrimonio se ornatissimo spoliari maluit quam ullam moram cui-
quam fieri creditorum suorum. A quo quidem genere, judices,
ego numquam timui, quum in illa rei publicae tempestate versarer.
Illud erat genus hominum horribile et pertimescendum, qui tanto
amore suas possessiones amplexi tenebant ut ab his membra divelli
citius ac distrahi posse diceres. Sittius numquam sibi cognationem
cum praediis esse existimavit suis. Itaque se non modo ex sus-
picione tanti sceleris, verum etiam ex omni hominum sermone, non

armis, sed patrimonio suo vindicavit.

‘though he had debts in Rome, he had
very large sums due to him in the provinces
and by the princes of Africa.'

coynationem] Sylvius compares the fol-
lowing passage (Pro Balbo, c. 25) ε “ simul
illud nesciebat, praediorum nullam esse
gentem3 emptionibus ea solere saepe ad
alienos homines, saepe ad infimos, non legi-
bus, tanquam tutelas, pervenire.'’

The following passage from Rudorff(Gro-
mat. Inst. ii. p. 302) will explain this pas-
sage and ¹give the reader some notions of
Roman institutions: “The city Rome, ac-
cording to an old tradition, assigned out
of its most antient. territory two ‘jugera' to
each Assiduus sor house, eourtyard‚ and
garden. These Romulian ‘ bina jugera⁷ re-
ceived the Gentile name (nomen) of the
family, to which they were originally as-
signed. A hundred such allotments made
up a Centuria.-Tlie hereditary and inalien-
able quality of this family property (⁶ here-
dem sequi ’) appears from the name ⁴ here-
dium,’ ‘jus hereditarium‚' ⁴ locus heredum,’
‘loca hereditaria,’ and from the complete
want of a form of ahenation, for the oldest
mode of transfer, the ‘ in jure cessio,' arose
out of the form of procedure. If the
⁴ heredes' were several, the whole property
was distributed according to the hereditary
shares into ideal fractions (‘ unciae’), which
by division (⁵ heretum ciere') could be changed
into real shares. Thus we find in Valerius
Maximus (iv. 4. 8) the following story :
‘⁶ Sexdecim eodem tempore Aelii fuerunt,
quibus una domuncula erat, quo nunc sunt
Mariana monumenta; et unus in agro Veiente
fundus minus multo cultores quam dominos
habcbat.'’-—Such was the poverty and sim-
plicity of early Roman times. A poor
people, who overstocked the land, became
a nation of soldiers. The t'emales of the
‘gens' had their hereditary portion with
the males, but the ‘tutela mulierum' sc-

cured their shares and did not allow them
to pass away. In a note, Rudorff refers to
this passage of the oration Pro Sulla, and
to the passage in the De Oratore, ii. 55:
“ Ubi sunt ii fundi, Brute, quos tibi pater
publicis commentariis consignatos reliquit.’'
Compare the passage in the Oration Pro
Cluentio, c. 51. According to Asconius,
the Censors expelled C. Antonius from the
Senate, “quod propter aeris alieni magni-
tudinem praedia mancipavit ;” but at that
time the fact of his being embarrassed was
the cause of the expulsion, I suppose.

21. objicit] ⁴ objecit,' Halm, for which
there is good authority3 ‘subjicit,’ Orelli.
-Λ per Pompeianos habere ε’ T. Halm ; ‘ et
Pompeianos habere,’ Orelli. Pompeii in
Campania at the foot of Vesuvius and at
the mouth of the Sarnus (Sarno), received
a colony of Veterani under the Dictator
Sulla. Pompeii is first mentioned by Livy
(ix. 38). When Sulla¹s colony was estab-
lished at Pompeii, P. Sulla was one of the
Ill. viri coloniae deducendam and he be-
came one of the Patroni of the Colonia.
The Colonia had the name of Colonia Ve-
neria Cornelia (lWommsen, Inscr. R. Neap.
Lat. Nor. 2201). The coloni had or claimed
to have some superiority over the people of
Pompeii. Sulla’s colony was settled after
the Social war, and the old inhabitants re-
ceived the Civitas with the other Italians,
we must suppose, after B.c. 89, in which
year Sulla besieged the place. Whether
Sulla treated the Pompeiani like the people
of Volaterrae and other places, we do not
know, hut it may he so. Halm supposes
that the old inhabitants sank to the mere
condition of ⁴ incolae,’ and had neither votes
in the eonimunity nor scats in the theatres
appropriated to the Coloni and in other
public buildings. A quarrel at Pompeii
during an exhibition of gladiators between
the colonists of Nuceria and the Pompeiani
is mentioned by Tacitus (Ann. xiv. 17).
