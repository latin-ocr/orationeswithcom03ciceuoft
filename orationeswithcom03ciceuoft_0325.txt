Kalendis J an. tertio loeo sententiam rogaras, constrictum inimicis
rei publicae t-radidisti3 tu meum generum, propinquum tuum, tu
affinem tuam, filiam meam, superbissimis et crudelissimis verbis a
genibus tuis reppulisti3 idemque tu, clementia ac misericordia
singulari, quum ego una cum re publica non tribunicio, sed con-
sulari ictu concidissem, tanto scelere tantaque intemperantia fuisti,
ut ne unam quidem horam interesse paterere inter meam pestem
et tuam praedam, saltem dum conticesceret illa lamentatio et
gemitus urbis. Nondum palam factum erat occidisse rem publicam,
quum tibi arbitria funeris solvebantur. Uno eodemque tempore
domus mea diripiebatur, ardebat3 bona ad vicinum consulem de
Palatio, de Tusculano ad item vicinum alterum consulem defereban-
tur, quum, iisdem operis suffragium ferentibus, eodem gladiatole
lator,e vacuo non modo a bonis, sed etiam a libelis atque inani foro,
ignaro populo Romano quid ageretur, senatu vero oppresso et
afflicto, duobus impiis nefariisque consulibus aerarium, provinciae,
legiones, imperia donabantur.

VIII. Horum consulum ruinas vos consules vestra virtute
fulsistis, summa tribunorum plebis praetorumque fide et diligentia
sublevati. Quid ego de praestantissimo viro T. Annio dicam, aut
quis de tali cive satis digne umquam loquetur? Qui quum videret

the‘ arbitria funeris' were so fahed, becaus se

arbitriaszmeris solvebantur] The pas· These passages show that

sage in the oration In Pison. e. 9, is this:

“eodem in templo, eodem et loci vestigio
et temporis arbitria non mei solum sed
patriae funeris abstulisti.’' Wolf considers
the passage in the text to be a puerile imi-
tation of the passage in the Piso, and he is
willing to take any man as judge in the
case, who shall think that he possesses a
clear judgment. Ι leave those who think
that they have it to make themselves judges
in the matter.

The ‘arbitria’ are the funeral expenses,
or what is paid to the undertakers and per-
sons who are employed about a funeral.
Klotz refers to a passage of Ulpian (Dig.
ll.7. 12. ξ 5, the 'litle de ieligios is et
sumptibus funerum, &e ) where it is said.

“Sumptus funeris arbitrantur pro faculta-
tibus vel dignitate defuncti3 ” which helps
to explain‘ arbitria.' But there is another
passage about the expense of funerals which
is inore to the purpose (14. §7): “ Sed
interdum is qui sumptum 111 funus feeit,
sumptum non recipit, veluti si pietatis gra-
tia feeit, non hoc animo quasi recepturus
sumptum quem f‹·cit; et ita Imperator nos-
ter rescripsit. Igitur aestimandum crit ab
arbitro et perpendendum quo animo sump-

they were estimated by proper persons and
fixed according to the rank and wealth of
the deceased. The‘ arbiter’ might als ohaxe
to decide whether the person who had paid
the funeral expenses was entitled to have
them repaid. (See Hor. Sat. ii. 3. v. 86.)
ad vicinum consulem] This was Piso, who
received in the house of his mother-in-law
the plunder taken from Cicero's house on
the Palatine. His other good neighbour at
Tusculum, Gabinius, received the plunder
of Cicero’s Tusculan villa (De Domo, c.
24). At his villa at Tusculum Cicero had
built a gymnasium (Ad Att. i. l, 4), and he
had adorned the place with statues at great
eost. llis Tusculanum and Pompeianum
were his favourite villas (Ad Att. ii. l).

8. Horum eona-ulum ruinas] He means the
ruinous condition to which Piso and Gabi-
nius brought the State3 which was au un-
sat'e house (aedes ruinosas») and required
proppiug or shoring up, which seems to
have been donc at Rome as it is in London.
But before the new consuls set about prop-
ping up the old house, they were them-
selves raised (snhlevnti) by the tribuni and
praetores. (vol. ll. De Leg. Agr. ii. c. 35.)
