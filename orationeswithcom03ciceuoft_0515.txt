GAP. 17—19. 501

principibus civitatis putabant, tribunum popularem a se alienare no-
lebant, suaque sibi propiora esse pericula quam mea loquebantur.
Sed tamen et Crassus a consulibus meam caussam suscipiendam esse
dicebat, et eorum fidem Pompeius implorabat, neque se privatum
publice susceptae caussae defuturum esse dicebat3 quem virum stu-
diosum mei, cupidissimum rei publicae conservandae, domi meae
certi homines ad eam rem positi monuerunt ut esset cautior, ejus-
que vitae a me insidias apud me domi positas esse dixerunt; atque
hanc ei suspicionem alii litteris mittendis, alii nuntiis, alii coram
ipsi excitaverunt, ut ille, quum a me certe nihil timeret, ab illis,
ne quid meo nomine molirentur, sibi cavendum putaret. Ipse autem
Caesar, quem maxime homines ignari veritatis mihi esse iratum
putabant, erat ad portas, erat cum imperiO, erat in Italia ejus exer-
citus, inque eo exercitu ipsius tribuni plebis, inimici mei, fratrem
praefecerat.
XIX. Haec ergo quum viderem—neque enim erant occulta,—
l senatum, sine quo civitas stare non posset, omnino de civitate esse
sublatum3 consules, qui duces publici consilii esse deberent, per-
fecisse ut per ipsos publicum consilium funditus tolleretur; eos qui
plurimum possent opponi omnibus contionibus falso, sed formido-
lose tamen, auctores ad perniciem meam 3 contiones haberi quotidie
contra me3 vocem pro me ac pro re publica neminem mittere;
intenta signa legionum existimari cervicibus ac bonis vestris falso,

‘ publice susceptae‚' he would as a private
individual help them.

domi meae . . . posili] The men were
placed in his house or sent there to ex-
amine, but it is not said what they
could see or what probable lie they could
make out of what they saW. See De
Domo, c. 21. Halm compares Livy iii.
33: ‘⁴ defosso cadavere domi apud P. Ses-
tium.”

iynarz' veritatis] Not knowing his real
reasons for keeping silent; he kept silent,
not because he was offended at Cicero,
but because he was afraid of offending Clo-
dius.

erat ad portas,] Caesar was there, but
his army was not3 but the Declamator
(Quum Senatui, c. 13, note) says that it

1 was. ¹⁴ For Caesar did not set out to the
Ι war until he had expelled Cicero. Plutarch,

Caesar, c. 14” (Manutius). But Plutarch
does not say that his army was at the gates
of Rome. Halm refers to Drumann‚ iii.
p. 222, διο. But Drumann does not say that

publice susceptae] If the consuls would Caesar’s army was at the gates of Rome.

‘eique exercitui 3’ but that is a different
thing. Here it is ⁴ gave him a command in
that army.’ Caesar in his Commentaries
never mentions Appius Claudius Pulcher,
the brother of Clodius.

19. eos quiplurimum possent] M. Cras-
sus, PompeiuS, and Caesa1·.—‘ opponi omni-
bus contionibus :' ‘ were presented to all the
assemblies of the people in a false way, but
still in a way to excite alarin, as men who
planned my ruin.’ Halm compares c. 23,
where ‘opponere' occurs twice in this sense;
and Ad Fam. x. 28, “ nisi. . . is oppositus
esset terror Antonio.¹'

intenta sigma leyionum] “ Consultis-
simo temperamento et C. Caesarem per-
stringit invidia et tamen nihil accusat ex-
serte,'’ &a (schol.) It was false however,
and every body would know that it was false 3
for if Caesar had then brought his troops
from Gallia Cisalpina over the Rubicon, he
would have declat-ed war against his country,
as he did in B.c. 49.
