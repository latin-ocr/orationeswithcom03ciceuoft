vitae tempore esse dimittendam commemorationem nominis nostri,
sed cum omni posteritate adaequandam. XII. An vero tam parvi
animi videamur esse 01111105, qui in re publica atque in his vitae
periculis laboribusque versamur, ut, quum usque ad extremum
spatium nullum tranquillum atque otiosum spiritum duxerimus,
nobiseum simul moritura omnia arbitremur? An statuas et
imagines, non animorum simulacra sed corporum, studiose inulti
summi homines reliquerunt, consiliorum relinquere ae virtutum
nostrarum effigiem nonne multo malle debemus summis ingeniis ex-
pressam et politam? Ego vero omnia quae gerebam jam tum in
gerendo spargere me ae disseminare arbitrabar in orbis terrae me-
moriam sempiternam. Haec vero sive a meo sensu post mortem
afutura est, sive, ut sapientissimi homines putaverunt, ad aliquam

dimittendam] Lambinus ‘ scripturae ve-
teris vestigia secutus ' wrote ‘dimetiendam’
Halm has ‘dimetandam‚' which is Bergk’s
emendation, if we can call that an emenda-
tion which is a gross corruption. Baiter
keeps ‘dimittendam’ It is easy to see how
Bergk was misled. Many critics are so
elever that they outwit themselves.

12. statuas et imayines‚] Ursini thinks
that this is an imitation of a passage in the
Evagoras of Isocrates: Ἐγώ δε, ὦ Νικόκλεις,
ἡγοῦμαι καλὰ μὲν, διο. (c. 30). The sen-
timent is the same3 but it is a ⁴ locus com-
munis.’ Tacitus has it also in the last chap-
ter of the Agricola.

ut sapientissimi] The latest expression
of Cicero’s opinions on the immortality of
the soul, for he means that by the words
‘ad aliquam mei partem pertinebit‚’ is in
the De Senectute, c. 21, &cu After giving
the opinions of Plato and Xenophon, which
are those of Socrates on the immortality of
the 50111, 110 comes to the Romans (c. 23) ς
and he says that the great men whom he
there speaks of, would never have done
what they did, if they had not mentally
seen ‘ that posterity or future ages apper-
tained to them ' (ad se pertinere) ; sor which
I find no translation, and therefore 1 use 3
Latin word. He then sayS‚ “An 0011505, ut de
me ipso aliquid more senum glorier, me tan-
tos labores diurnos nocturnosque domi mili-
tiaeque suscepturum fuisse, si iisdem tinibus
gloriam meam quibus vitam essem termina-
turus ?'’ It is old Cato who is speaking, but
Cicero puts the words in his mouth.

This passage and the others that have
been referred to mark the character of
Cicero‘s practica! philosophy. Ifhis glory
was to end with his life, would it not have
been better, he says, to spend a life of in„

dolence? The motive for action is men's
praise, a word, a breath; praise that shall
survive his life, and of which he shall some
way he conscious. The utmost he could
imagine of another existence was a perpe-
tual consciousness of men's talk about him.
He adds a few other things (De Sen. c. 23),
but this is the leading idea there, and here
it is every thing. A meaner, more 1111131110
notion cannot be imagined; and we should
do wrong to old Cato’s memory and the
illustrious Romans of Rome's heroic age, to
attribute to them the same mean motives
that Cicero attributes to himself. The ap-
probation of the good is a motive to action;
and the belief that when a man is gone, if
he is remembered, he will be honourably
remembered, is, as Cicero says, 3 pleasing
thought to him. But 3 111311 may labour
honestly and well without getting any body’s
approbation, and he will often get many
men’s censure and abuse both while he is
living and after he is dead. What then
remains? Why, to follow Antoninus' ad-
vice, and to do what you believe to be
right, and not to trouble yourself about
what people may say of you either now or
after you are dead. Remember how soon
you are forgotten. The greatest live only
a short time in men's memorie53 and they
are often remembered as much for the bad
they have done as for the good.

The Stoics had a higher standard than
Cicero. They found a motivo for activity
and duty in living conformably to Nature,
for the constitution of man’s Nature shows
him what he should do. Accordingly tho
Stoics could found a morality independent
of 1110 belief in a future existence. for they
were divided in opinion on the immortality
of the 50111, but this did not make any dis.
