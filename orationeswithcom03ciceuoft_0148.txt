134 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

possum. At ego verissime dixerim peccare te nihil, neque ulla in
re te esse hujusmodi ut corrigendus potius quam leviter inflectendus
esse videare. Finxit. enim te ipsa natura ad honestatem, gravita-
tem, temperantiam, magnitudinem animi, justitiam, ad omnes denique
virtutes magnum hominem et excelsum. Accessit [istuc] doctrina
non moderata nec mitis, sed, ut mihi videtur, paullo asperior et
durior quain aut veritas aut natura patitur. Et quoniam non est
nobis haec oratio habenda aut in imperita multitudine, aut in aliquo
conventu agrestium, audacius paullo de studiis humanitatis, quae
et mihi et vobis nota et jucunda sunt, disputabo. In M. Catone,
judices, haec bona, quae videmus, divina et egregia, ipsius scitote
esse propria : quae nonnumquam requirimus, ea sunt onmia non a na-
tura, verum a magistro. Fuit enim quidam summo ingenio vir, Zeno,

Zona] Zeno, the founder of the Stoic
sect, carne from Citium in Cyprus· He
heard several philosophers, Crates, Stilpo,
Xenocrates, and Polemon. His place of
resort at Athens was the Stoa called Poe-
cile, and hence his followers were named
Stoici. The period of his great celebrity
was the time of Antigonus Gonatas (Diog.
Laert. vii l). He was originally a trader,
and one of the very few examples of a
money-making man turning philosopher.
He lived to a great age, and is said to have
been at the head of his school for fifty-eight
years. Such a man must have had a great
intluence in his day, something like that
exercised in modern times by preachers such
as Wesley and others. The Greek philo-
sophers can hardly be compared with the
philosophie-al teachers of modern times3
for though they have had influence, it is
generally by their writings more than by
their lectures, and by practical results.
Zeno left some writings on moral subjects
(Diog. vii. 4), but no great amount. He
wrote also on purely speculative matters;
for instance, he had the following opinion
of the origin of man. an opinion which leads
to consequences: “Zenon Citieus, Stoicae
sectae conditor, principium humano generi
ex novo mundo constitutum putavit, primos-
que homines ex solo adminiculo divini ignis,
id est dei providentia, genitos'’ (Censori-
nus, De die natali, c. 4). We do not know
exactly what he taught. for his followers
were split in opinion, and we have no rea-
son for assigning to the father of the Stoics
the absurdities which Cicero riclicules There
were pretenders to Stoicism, whom Epicte-
tus strictly distinguished from the true men ;
he said there was besides the true and sin-

cere Stoic, a rabble of miserable fellows who
called themselves Stoics, and while throwing
the black soot of words and sophistry before
the eyes of their hearers, falsely assumed
the name of a most honourable sect (Gel-
lius. i. 2). Cicero (Acad. Post.. i. ll ; Acad.
Pr. ii. 47) has some remarks on Zeno's
Logica. Posidonius, a Stoic, a pupil and
successor ot' Panaetius, had a school at
Rhodes, and Cicero, Pompeius, and many
other Romans heard him there (Cicero,
Tusc. ii. 25; De Nat. Deorum, i. 3). This
Posidonius was worth listening to. He was
not a mere speculator. Before teaching at
Rhodes he had travelled in the west of
Europe and seen many men and many cities.
He settled at Rome in the consulship of
M. Marcellus, 13.c. 51, which was twelve
years after the date of this oration.

The later development ot‘ Stoicism at
Rome belongs to the empire; to Seneca,
Musonius (Tacit. Hist. iii. 81), Epictetus,
and to the greatest name that has yet ap-
peared in practical philosophy, the Empe-
ror Marcus Antoninus, who tempered the
severity of the Stoics with the mildness of
his own humane and benevolent disposition.
The Stoic was the philosophy of the noblest
of the Romans. It was the true philosophy
for the man who commanded armies and
humbled kings without forgetting that he
was himself subject to fortune and liable to
infirmities. It is the philosophy of the man
who can dare, do, and suffer.

The ridiculous extravagances of some of
the professed Stoies of his time were ridi·
culed by Horat-e (Sar. i. 3 v. 216) with effect.
He had attended lectores at Athens, and
perhaps he had passed some tedious hours

in hearing acute men try to prove what, no-
body can believe :—
