CAP. 38—40. 531

tum introducti, confessi, in vincla conjecti a Milone, emissi a Ser-
rano: mentio nulla. F orum corporibus civium Romanorum con-
stratum caede nocturna : non modo nulla nova quaestiO, sed etiam
vetera judicia sublata. Tribunum plebis plus viginti vulneribus
acceptis jacentem moribundumque vidistis: alterius tribuni plebis,
divini hominis,—-dicam enim quod sentio et quod mecum sentiunt
omnes—divini, insigni quadam, inaudita, nova magnitudine animi,
gravitate, fide praediti, domus est oppugnata ferro, facibus, exercitu
Clodiano.

XL. Et tu hoc loco laudas Milonem et jure laudas.v Quem
enim umquam virum tam immortali virtute vidimus? qui nullo
praemio proposito praeter hoc, quod jam contritum et contemptum
putatur, judicium bonorum, omnia pericula, summos labores,
gravissimas contentiones inimicitiasque suscepit? qui mihi unus ex
omnibus civibus videtur re docuisse, non verbis, et quid oporteret
a praestantibus viris in re publica fieri et quid necesse esset:
oportere hominum audacium, eversorum rei publicae sceleri legibus
et judiciis resistere; si leges non valerent, judicia non essent, si
res publica vi consensuque audacium armis oppressa teneretur,
praesidio et copiis defendi vitam et libertatem necesse esse. Hoc
sentire prudentiae est, facere fortitudinis; et sentire vero et facere

 

perfectae cumulataeque virtutis.

was delivered. Wolf remarks in his note
(Quum Senatui, c. 8) that Middleton (Life
of Cicero) makes the Postulatio mentioned
in the Quum Senatui follow the attack
spoken ofin the letter, and that Hotmann
in his note on the Quum Senatui, c. 8, and
Manutius in his note on the Pro Sestio, c.
39, say the same. This is a way of charg-
ing the Declamator with a mistake which
he has not made: at least he does not say
that Milo attempted to prosecute Clodius
for this act of violence. Cicero speaks here
of an attack made before his return from
exile, and in the letter of an attack made
after his return. In c. 41 he speaks of a
prosecution.

If we suppose that Clodius twice attacked
Milo’s house, Cicero is consistent. Halm
says, “since nothing is known of a former
attack on Milo’s house, the orator must be
considered to have cunningly changed the
times, with the view. as I suppose, of mak-
ing a better excuse for Milo arming himself
against Clodius’ partizans.'' I see no cun-
ning, but a great deal of folly, in telling a
barefaced lie about a recent and notorious
event.

Adiit ad rem publicam tribunus

40. hoc loco] &Vhen the accusator spoke
of Milo’s house being assaulted (Manutius).
Halm says: But if the attack was made
afterwards—he means of course made after
Cicero's return · it does not seem likely that
the prosecutor ‘hoc loco' spoke ot‘ it, but
that he compared what Milo did in that
troublesome time with what Sestius did,
and for the purpose of making Sestius' case
appear worse.—This remark assumes that
Clodius did not attack Milo’s house during
Cicero’s exile ; but Cicero says that he did,
and that Milo repelled force by force.

et sentire vero] Manutius, copied by
Halm, has a trifling note on ‘ sentire ' and
‘faceres as if he could make that clearer
which Cicero has well expressed. To know
what is right and to do it are two different
things. He is a full man in whom we find
both. Halm translates ⁴ vero‚’ an emphatic
word, by ⁴ erst gar‚' ⁴ vollends.’

Adiit ad rem publicam] Hc explains it,
if it wants explanation, by other words,
‘ Adiit . . . ad caussam rei publicae.'—-‘ pa-
rem Sestii caussam:y Cicero assumes that
Milo and Sestius had done the same thing,
and if Milo merits the praise which the pro-
