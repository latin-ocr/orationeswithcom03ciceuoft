QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT.—QUUM POPULO
GRATIAS Remu—DE DOMO SUA.

THEsE three orations will be better understood by the following histo-
rical sketch.

The year of Cicero‘s consulship (13.6. 63) was the most glorious period
of his life, as he tells us. He frustrated the designs of a desperate band
of conspirators, and saved his country from a bloody revolution. But
his services to the State made him many enemies, and his own impru-
dence and vanity increased the number. The execution of the five con-
spirators at Rome was an illegal act, for the Senate had 110 power to put
Roman citizens to death; which could only be done by a vote of the
Roman people in the Comitia Centuriata. Cicero was not responsible
for this illegality, but he was the man who discovered the conspiracy,
who urged the Senate to punish, who saw the sentence executed. At
the termination of his consulship on the last day of the year, when 116
ascended the Rostra to give an account to the people‚ as was usual, of
his administration, the tribune Q. Metellus Nepos, instigated, it is said,
by the party opposed to the Optimates and chiefly by Caesar, would not
allow him to do more than make the usual declaration that he had done
nothing contrary to Law. Upon this Cicero declared in the most solemn
manner that he had saved his country, and the people responded that he
had said no more than the truth (Cicero, To Q. Metellus Celer, Ad
Fam. v. 23 Plutarch, Cicero, 6. 23; Cicero, Pro Sulla, c.11‚ 11016).
Metellus Nepos continued his hostility to Cicer03 and he even proposed
that Pompeius and his army should be recalled from the east to restore
the order, which, as he alleged, Cicero and his party had destroyed.
M. Cato, who was then a ‘tribunus plebis,’ opposed the proposal of
Metellus, and he was supported by the Senate. The streets of Rome
became the scene of bloody riots‚ and Metellus, according to some
accounts, being deprived of his tribunitian office, made his escape to
