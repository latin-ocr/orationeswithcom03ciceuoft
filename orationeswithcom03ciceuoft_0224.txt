210 ORAT. PRO A. LICINIO ARCHIA

rum artium studiis ac disciplina profecta, a qua ego nullum confiteor
aetatis meae tempus abhorruisse, earum rerum omnium vel in primis
hic A. Licinius fructum a me repetere prope suo jure debet. Nam
quoad longissime potest mens mea respicere spatium praeteriti tem-
poris et pueritiae memoriam recordari ultimam, inde usque repetens
hunc video mihi principem et ad suscipiendam et ad ingrediendam
rationem horum studiorum exstitisse. Quod si haec vox hujus
hortatu praeceptisque conformata nonnullis aliquando saluti fuit,
a quo id accepimus quo ceteris opitulari et alios servare possemus,
huic profecto ipsi quantum est situm in nobis et opem et salutem
ferre debemus. Ac 116 quis a nobis hoc ita dici forte miretur, quod
alia quaedam in hoc facultas sit ingenii neque haec dicendi ratio aut

disciplina, ne 1105 quidem huic uni studio penitus umquam dediti

fuimus.

in art (ars) or in natural talent (i. 23, &c.).
It lies in both, but without nature a man
will not get much from art.

hic A. Licinius] He gives him a Roman
name. The praenomen Aulus does not be-
long to any of the Luculli, so far as we
know. There are many examples of Greeks
adopting the Gentile name of their patrous
(Vol. I. Verr. ii. 4. c. 17).

prope suo jure] ⁴ Almost as his own by
right.’ (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 5. c. 1.) The
‘ fructus ’ of Cicero’s talent, if he had any,
of his practice as a speaker, and of his ora-
1011631 principles or art, was his ‘oratoria
facultas,’ his oratorical power; and as
Archias had helped to sow the seeds, 116
had almost a right to claim the fruits.

pueritiae memoriam] Archias came to
Rome in B.c. 102, when Cicero was four
years old. Cicero rame to Rome before
Β c. 91. He does not speak of Archias as
his master in rhetoric3 but he was indebted
to him for something. example, exhorta-
tion, and advice at least. ·

vetaris . . . alios] ⁶ Help every body else,
and rescue some.' For ‘alios’ is simply
‘ others.' not Archias 3 and ‘ceteri' are ‘all
not including Archias.'

possemus] ‘ possumus,' G. E. and Halm.
Either may do, but the meaning is not the
same. Baiter 1135 ‘ possemus)

huic uni] Cicero alludes to his own
poetical writingS. He begun with poetry.
as many clever boys do, and ended with
prose (Plutarch, Cicero, c. 2.) The Mss.
have ‘huic cuncti’ or 66111111,ν which has
long since been changed to ‘huic uni.’
⁴ Puteanus, huicce uni ' (Baiter). If ⁴ huic
uni ' is not the true reading, it makes sense
at least3 and ‘cuncti' does not, for we

cannot accept Manutius' explanation that
⁴ cuncti’ is the 531116 35 ‘toti.' ‘Cuncti'
is ‘ omnes conjuncti‚' as Festus says. (See
Vol. Ι. Divin. c. l.)

humanitatem] Halm quotes another pas-
sage of Cicero, in which he expresses the
same clear and enlarged view of the con-
nexion, the kinship of all the arts and
sciences. It is Plato’s saying however, but
not the worse for that: “Est etiam illa
Platonis vera . . . vox, Omnem doctrinam
harum ingenuarum et humanarum artium
uno quodam societatis vinculo contineris*
(De Or. iii. c. 6.) The remark may be
useful to those very superficial people, who
cannot praise their own pursuits without
1166111119,Γ 111056 of others.

The critics dispute how much is expressed
by ‘ humanitas' in this passage. Manutius
limits it to oratory, poetry, history; 01*⁸
perhaps he names these only as examples.
But ‘humanitas' comprises all that cha-
racterizes man as a rational animal. ⁴ Hu-
manitas’ came from the Greeks, says Cicero
to his brother (Ad Q. Fr. i. 1. c. 9): it was
the fruit of Grecian civility. The arts and
philosophy of Greece humanized Rome3
and the ‘ humanitas’ of Greece and Rome
resrued modern Europe from 115 savagc
state. We still cling to this ‘humanitas’
as our only hope and our safety against a
fresh age of barbarism. We must adopt
the word ‘ humanity’ in this its wide sense,
as we have it in a narrower sense. The
Romans used it both ways, and 35 our lan—
guage is now Roman, we must adopt in
its eulargcd sense 1116 word which shows
our obligation to the Romans, and ex-
presses something for which we want 311
expression.
