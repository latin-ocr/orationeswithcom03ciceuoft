324 ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

modisque depositis, totam suam quaesturam in me sustentando et
conservando collocavit. Qui si mihi quaestor imperatori fuisset,
in filii loco fuisset: nunc certe erit in parentis, quum fuerit quaestor
non imperii, sed doloris mei.

Quapropter, patres conscripti, quoniam in rem publicam sum
pariter cum re publica restitutus, non modo in ea defendenda nihil
imminuam de libertate mea pristina, sed etiam adaugebo. XV. Et-
enim, si eam tum defendebam quum mihi aliquid illa debebat, quid
nunc me facere oportet, quum ego illi plurimum debeo? Nam quid
est quod animum meum frangere aut debilitare possit, cujus ipsam
calamit-atem non modo nullius delicti, sed etiam divinorum in rem
publicam beneficiorum testem esse videatis? Nam [et] importata
est, quia defenderam civitatem, et mea voluntate suscepta est, ne a.
me defensa res publica per eundem me extremum in discrimen

vocaretur.

audivit (Plancius), statim ad me lictoribus
dimissis, insignibus abjectis, veste mutata
profectus est.’' He adds, “multosque
menses a capite meo non discessit abjecta
quaestoria persona comitisque sumpta.’'
But this does not explain ‘commoda’ Wolf
has a note on this passage, which begins,
“ Plancii supra oblitus erat pius orator3
itaque eum (nam nefas quemquam prae-
terire) commemorat ante portam clauden-
dam.’'

The next sentence contains great difficul-
ties. Halm says “ verba imperatori et cum
suerit . . . doloris mei auctore Garatonio in
Curis Sec. ad Plancianam p. 60 ut spuria
significavi.'’ This is a short way of settling
the difficulty.

Markland says correctly that a man did not
get a Quaestor in his capacity of Imperat0r3
nor had Cicero yet had the title of Impera-
tor. He only got it some years later when
he was governor of Cilicia, and had ob-
tained some victories over the mountaineers
of the Amanus. Markland conjectures that
the writer of this speech did not know the
difference between Imperator and ⁴ esse
cum imperio‚' which was said generally of a
provincial governor. But whatever error
there is in the use of Imperator here, we can
hardly suppose that the writer of this speech
did not know what Imperator meant, and the
difference between that word and the expres-
sion ‘cum imperio esse.' Gesner’s answer
is that what Cicero says, ‘si mihi quaestor
imperatori fuisset‚' is said hypothetically3
but still the question is why Imperatori,
and not Praetori or Consuli, which would

Pro me non, ut pro P. Popillio, nobilissimo homine,

have been the usual form of expression.
Wolf wonders that Gesner was not satisfied
with Markland's exact and correct examina-
tion of this passage. But Wolf tells us
why Imperatori is used. It was put in to
prepare the way for the choice morsel
‘ quaestor non imperii sed doloris mei.' A
‘ quaestor imperii,’ and a ¹ quaestor doloris '
are a couple of monsters. “ Quidni potius
Quaestorem lacrimarum .7 ut tamen sit ali-
quid, quod custodire Quaestor, et in quo
vim tituli sui exercere possit ” (Wolf).

in rem publicam . . . cum re publica]
Here he says he was re-established in the
State together with the State. He and the
State were restored to the State, which is
fiat nonsense 3 and contradicts what he just
said, that the Res Publica left the city when
he did, and when the Res Publica was re-
called, she brought him back with her, not
into the Res Publica, but into the city.

imminuam] E. F. Halm has ‘ minuam.'
Heumann conjectured ⁶ eam adaugebo.'

15. divinornm . . . beneficiorum] This
is certainly rather too much for a man to
say of himself, too much even for Cicero to
say to the Roman Senate. “Tam magni-
fice Cicero non potuit in Senatu praedicare
de meritis suis. Peccat iu hac re omnemque
modum excedit Auctor Declamationis Ante-
quam iret in atilium: qui plane facit ut
mali poetae, qui in scena personas suas in-
ducunt ea loquentes, quaecumque ipsi sen-
tiunt'¹ (Wolf).
