XXVII. Multa acerba, multa turpia, multa turbulenta habuit
ille annus3 tamen illi sceleri, quod in me illorum immanitas edidit,
haud scio an recte hoc proximum esse dicam. Antiochum Mag-
num illum majores nostri magna belli contentione terra marique
superatum intra montem Taurum regnare jusserunt: Asiam, qua
illum multarunt, Attalo ut is regnaret in ea condonaverunt. Cum
Armeniorum rege Tigrane grave bellum pei-diuturnumque gessimus,
quum ille injuriis in socios nostros inferendis bello prope nos laces-

hujus imperii Mithridatem pulsum Ponto opibus suis regnoque
defendit, et ab L. Lucullo, summo viro atque imperatore, pulsus
animo tamen hostili cum reliquis suis copiis in pristina mente
mansit. Hunc Cn. Pompeius, quum in suis castris supplicem abjec-
tum vidisset, erexit atque insigne regium, quod ille de suo capite
abjecerat, reposuit et certis rebus imperatis regnare jussit, nec
minus et sibiet huic imperio gloriosum putavit constitutum a se
regern quam constrictum videri. . tulit, gessit, qui et ipse
hostis fuit populi Romani et acerrimum hostem in regnum recepit,

Antiochum IiIaymcm] This was the and finally, when Pompeius came towards

Syrian king who was defeated at Magnesia
near Sipylus by L. Scipio B.c. 190 (Livy
37. cv 37, 45; 38. e. 38). The ternis im-
posed on Antiochus were: “excedito urbi-
bus, agris, vicis, castellis cis Taurum mon-
tem usque ad Tanaim amnem et a valle
Tauri usque ad juga qua in Lycaoniam ver-
git.’' Attalus Ι. of Pergamum, the ally
of the Romans against Antiochus, died B.c.
197. He was succeeded by Eumenes ΙΙ.,
to whom the Romans after the end of the
war with Antiochus gave both the Phrygias,
Mysia, and other parts of Asia (Livy 36.
c. 39). Gellius (xii. 13), quoted by Halm,
cites this passage, ‘Antiochum Magnum
. . . regnare jusserunt,' with this remark:
“qui regnat intra montem Taurum non
solum in monte Tauro regnat, sed in his
etiam regionibus quae Tauro monte claudun-
tur.'’

Tiyrane] There is something about
him in the De Imp. Cn. Pompeii (c. 9,
Vol. ΙΙ.). The war with Tigranes did not
last long, for he was defeated in one battle.

(2). G. has ‘bellum perdiuturnumque.'
But the text in this passage is doubtful.

him, pulling off his cittaris he hastened to
lay it before his feet, and what was most
humiliating of all, to throw himself down
on his knees. But Pompeius prevented
this by laying hold of his right hand and
drawing the king towards him ” (Plutarch,
Pompeius, c. 34).

tulit, μεθῶ] “ Postulat sententia, ut pro
tulit, yessit reponatur: Tiqranes z'yitur
vel iyitur is. Sed quoniam odi conjecturas,
quae a litterarum similitudine discedunt,
opem vett. librorum expectandam cense03
alioqui nihil tentandum'’ (Manutius); a
sensible remark.—‘ acerrimum hostem:’
Tigranes received king Mithridates, as he
means by the words ‘ opibus suis regnoque
defendit.’ “ Now up to this time Tigranes
had not deigned to see Mithridates, nor to
speak to him, though Mithridates was allied
to him by marriage, and had been ejected
from so great a kingdom 3 but in a degrading
and insulting manner, he had allowed Mith-
ridates to be far removed from him, and in
a manner kept a prisoner in his abode,
which was a marshy and unliealthy place.
However, he now sent for him with domon-
strations of respect and atfection’' (Plu-
tarch, Lucullus, c. 22).
