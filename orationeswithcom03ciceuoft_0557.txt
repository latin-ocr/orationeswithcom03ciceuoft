CAP. 47, 48. 543

Id, quod multi invideant multique expetant, inscitia est,
inquit,

Postulare, nisi laborem summa cum cura ecferas.
Nollem idem alio loco dixisset, quod exciperent improbi cives:
‘Oderint, dum metuant? praeclara enim illa praecepta dederat
juventuti. Sed tamen haec via, haec ratio rei publicae capessendae
olim erat magis pertimescenda, quum multis in rebus multitudinis
studium aut populi commodum ab utilitate rei publicae discrepabat.
Tabellaria lex ab L. Cassio ferebatur. Populus libertatem agi
putabat suam. Dissentiebant principes et in salute optimatium
temeritatem multitudinis et tabellae licentiam pertimescebant.
Agrariam Ti. Gracchus legem ferebat. Grata erat populo: for-
tunae constitui tenuiorum videbantur. Nitebantur contra opti-
mates, quod et discordiam excitari videbant et, quum locupletes
possessionibus diuturnis moverentur, spoliari rem publicam propug-
natoribus arbitrabantur. Frumentariam legem C. Gracchus ferebat.

 

seems to be incomplete in Cicero, for it was
originally a trochaic tetrameter catalectic.
The line in the Sestius is faulty in begin-
ning with ‘te ' if it is from the Atreus, for
the father is addressing his sons. Orelli
placed the ⁴ te’ before ‘ Postulare.’

“ Sed id quod . . .
Te postulare . . .''

following ‘⁴ Botheum, communem illum an-
tiquorum scriptorum corruptorem ;'’-he is
a man to be warned against, this Bothe 3-
but Orelli afterwards wrote thus :

“ Te id quod . . .
Postularem‚ si
Nullum.’'

Wunder thinks that Nobbe most truly saw
that these were tetrameter trochaic catalec-
tics. The wonder is that any body with ears
could take them for any thing else than
trochaics. Wunder finally would write the
verses thus :

‘⁴ Id quod multi . . .

Postulare, si laborem
Nullum.'’

P. G. have ‘sed te’ (but P¹ ‘et de ’):
‘postularent (postulare ΡΖ) sivi' P. G.
VVesenberg’s ‘ Postulare nisi ' is as good as
any thing we can make out.

Oderint, dum metuant:] These words
are quoted by Cicero, De Off. i. 28, and
Seneca, De Ira i. 163 but the author is
not mentioned. As however Cicero makes
them the words of Atreus, it is probable

that they are by Attius or Accius. Halm
compares Tacitus (Ann. xiv. 9): “occidat
dum imperet,'’ the words of Agrippina when
her son Nero’s future elevation and her own
death at his hands were foretold to her.

llaec via, haec ratio] ‘⁴ ‘haec via ac ratio’
Orelli (3), Halm (2) ; ‘ haec via hec (sed Ιι
051 111 raS.) ratio ' P.; ⁴ 11300 via 11300 ratio '
G.’' (Halm).—⁴ aut populi :' “ ‘aut' Iacob.
p. 7133 ‘ad' P. G.; ‘ ac’ O. ex conj.
Lamb.'’ (Halm).

Tabellaria lex] The Lex of C. Cassius
Longinus, tr. pl. Rc. 137, which enacted
that the people should vote by ballot in the
J udicia Publica at the Comitia Centuriata.
The Lex Tabellaria of Gabinius which esta-
blished the ballot 31. the Comitia for electione
was two years earlier: “Videtis in tabella
jam ante quanta facta sit labes, primo Ga-
binia lege, biennio autem post Cassia '’ (De
Am. c. 12). The Optimates did not like
the Tabellaria of Cassius, for they feared
that if there was secret voting, the vote
might be against them; and there was good
reason for their fear. There is greater ‘ li-
centia‚’ says Manutius, where the vote 15
given secretly (per tabellas) : greater liberty,
and greater licence too. But secret voting
fora magistratus, and secretvoting ona man's
guilt or innocence are very different things.
