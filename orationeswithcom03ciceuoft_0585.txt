repentina vi perculsi ac tempestate populari per populum tamen
ipsum recreati sunt atque revocati, aut omnino invulnerati invio-
latique vixerunt. At vero ii qui senatus consilium, qui auctori·
tatem bonorum, qui instituta majorum neglexerunt et imperitae
aut concitatae multitudini jucundi esse voluerunt, omnes fere rei
publicae poenas aut praesenti morte aut turpi exsilio dependerunt.
Quod si apud Athenienses, homines Graecos, longe a nostrorum
hominum gravitate disjunctos non deerant qui rem publicam contra.
populi temeritatem defenderent, quum omnes qui ita fecerant e
civitate ejicerentur; si Themistoclem illum, conservatorem patriae,
non deterruit a re publica defendenda nec Miltiadi calamitas, qui
illam civitatem paullo ante servarat, neque Aristidi fuga, qui unus
omnium justissimus fuisse traditum si postea summi ejusdem civi—
tatis viri, quos nominatim appellari non est necesse, propositis tot
exemplis iracundiae levitatisque popularis tamen suam rem pub·
licam illam defenderunt; quid nos tandem facere debemus, primum
in ea civitate nati, unde orta mihi gravitas et magnitudo animi
videtur, tum in tanta gloria insistentes, ut omnia humana leviora
videri debeant, deinde ad eam rem publicam tuendam aggressi, quae
tanta dignitate est ut eam defendentem occidere non aliud sit quam
oppugnantem rerum potiri?

(Durazzo) in Epirus. He is often men- the genuineness of the text, and translates
tioned by Cicero (In Cat. i. ⁶2). it ‘⁴ so that to fall in its defence is to be
praesenti morte] As Sp. Maelius, M. valued no less than in the struggle against

Manlius Capitolinus, the two Gracchi, L.
Apuleius Saturninus, P. Sulpicius, all of
whom lost their lives; M. Lepidus, who was
consul with Q. Catulus and attempted to
undo the work of Sulla, went into exile to
Sardinia (Manutius).

Themistoclem] Perhaps he was not so
honest as Cicero would represent him. At
any rate he turned a traitor to his country,
when he was obliged to leave it. If he was
ill used at home, he should have shown
that he did not deserve it..

Miltiadi. . . Aristidi] “Hae genitivorum
formae nunc ex Schol. restitutae sunt”
(Halm).

snam . . . illam] Bake proposes to change
‘illam' into ‘illis ‘ Illam ' is emphatic3
‘such as it was,’ fickle and ungrateful, as
Halm suggests. He also offers another ex-
planation.

non aliud] The critics have suggested
various corrections for ‘non aliud,' which
are as follows z ⁶ majus,' ‘ nobilius ’ ⁴ satius,’
‘ melius,' ‘ optabiliuS,' ‘ honestius,‘ ‘ nomen
majus‚’ and finally Halm proposes ‘ am-
plius,' or ⁴ multo amplius.' Klotz maintains

it to get possession of the power;” which
Halm ridicules in these words ε “ En habes
sententiam homine Romano dignam, qui
mortem in patria defendenda gloriose obitam
in eadem trutina collocet in qua domina-
tionem vi armisque ocrupatams' I believe
that the text is right, and that Klotz has
seen the meaning, though he has not well
expressed it. ⁴ Rerum potiri' is to get
power, political power, or generally to get
what men love, wealth, power, place, for
which, says the poet, all the world is strug-

gling :
“ Noctes atque dies niti praestante labore

Ad summas emergere opes rerumque
potiri.” (Lucretius ii. 12.)

If Cicero said, according to the emenda-
tors, that to die in defence of the Patria is
‘greater‚' ‘more nohle‚' ‘better,' and so
forth, than to usurp the sovereign power,
he uttered a very insipid proposition ; if he
considered· the usurpation of sovereign
power as so small and mean a thing, or if
he supposed that men generally supposed it
to be such. If we compare two things, one
