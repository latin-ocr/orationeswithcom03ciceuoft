204 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

reddiderit adempta ignominia foedissimi criminis. An vero inimi-
cum ut expellas? cujus ex miseriis, si esses crudelissimus, videndo
fructum caperes majorem quam audiendo. O miserum et infelicem
illum diem. quo consul omnibus centuriis P. Sulla renuntiatus est l
o falsam spem! o volucrem fortunam! o caecam cupiditatem! o
praeposteram gratulationem! Quam cito illa omnia ex laetitia et
voluptate ad luctum et lacrimas reciderunt, ut„ qui paullo ante
consul designatus fuisset, repente nullum vestigium retineret pris-
tinae dignitatis! Quid enim erat mali quod huic spoliato honore,
fama, fortunis, deesse videretur, aut cui novae calamitati locus ullus

relictus esset ἓ

Urget eadem fortuna quae coepit; repperit novum

maerorem; non patitur hominem calamitosum uno modo afflictum

uno in luctu perire.

XXXIII. Sed jam impedior egomet, judices, dolore animi ne

(le hujus miseria plura dicam.

Vestrae jam sunt partes, judices:

in vestra mansuetudine atque humanitate caussam totam repono.
Vos, rejectione interposita, nihil suspicantibus nobis, repentini in

An . . . ut expellas Β] “ That is to say
⁶ id agis (expetis) ut‚’ a change in the con-
struction after ‘ eripere vis ' has preceded.'’
Halm. I do not think that this is the ex-
planation. ‘ Expellas ⁹ depends on ‘ vis:’
‘⁴ Is it your design to drive him out of the
country ?” Cicero says in Vatin. c. 7 :
¹⁶ Volo ut mihi respondeas :¹⁵ ‘⁴ I demand an
answer from you.’'

omnibns centuriis] “Nam quum propter
dilationem comitiorum ter praetor primus
centuriis cunetis renuntiatus sum.'’ De
Imp. Cn. Pompeii, e. l.—‘reciderunt:’ the
true form would be ⁴ recciderunt,’ as we
have ⁴ repperit ⁷ shortly after. Lachmann
(Lucretius, i. 8.·17, 1063) writes ⁴ reccidere ’
even in the present tense 2·-

“ At neque reccidere ad nilum res posse
neque antem
Crescere de nilo testor res ante proba-
tas ’'

See his note (v. 614) 011 ‘ 1·ellatum‚’ ‘recci-
dere,’ ‘ redducunt‚’ and ⁴ redducere!

aut cui novae . . . relictus esset Β] Perhaps
the word ‘ videretur ’ led the orator almost
unconsciously to write ⁸ relictus esset,’ if it
is right. Halm suggests that it should be
either ‘relictus est,’ or ‘relictus esse ’ with
‘videbatur' understood. In his larger edition
he observes that Cod. Parcensis has ⁴ relic-
tus esse‚' and that F. Car. Wolff preferred
‘ relictus est!

33. dolore animi] His grief prevents him
from saying more. So it was when he spoke

for Milo: ‘⁶ Sed finis sit, neque enim prae
lacrimis jam loqui possum ’' (c. 38). This
is all rhetorical art or artifice. Perhaps it
was never said, and only written. Quin-
tilian tells us that the orator must be moved
before he can move others. If he is not
really moved, he must seem to be moved.
He must be an act0r3 with this differenee,
that the actor only attempts to represent
the passion of another, and if he does not
really feel, we impute no moral turpitude
to him; and yet he must feel if he would
move us deeply. If the orator feels not,
and only makes a show of feeling, we cou-
demn him as a hypocrite.

Vestraejam] ‘Vestrae suntjam‚⁹ Ε.Τ. Β.,
Halm. I think that he has the ‘jam' in the
wrong place. There is nothing in which
the MSS. differ so much as in the order οἳ
words, and it is often very difficule to decide
which order is best. Further on, Halm
writes ¹ Hoc cum a vobis impetrare,' where
again, I think that he is wrong. Further
on still he has ‘ In quo ego vos, judices,y in
place of the common reading ¹ In quo ego,
judices, vos 3’ where he is right.

rejectione imm-posita] The ‘rejectio ' is
‘she challenge of a ‘jutlex,’ the refusal of
the prosecutor 01· the accused to accept a
man as ¹ judex.’ Verres challenged some of
his judices (Vol. Ι. Act. i. c. 3, note). This
is a difficult passage. lIalm quotes Momm-
sen’s opinion (De Collegiis et sodalitiis, p.
(35), who says that the judices in these
causes were the so-called ‘editicii,’ whom
