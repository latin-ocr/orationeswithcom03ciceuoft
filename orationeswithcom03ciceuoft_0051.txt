permoventur. Video cui sit Apulia attributa, quis habeat Etru-
riam, quis agrum Picenum, quis Gallicum, quis sibi has urbanas
insidias caedis atque incendiorum depoposcerit. Omnia superioris
noetis consilia ad ine delata esse sentiunt: patefeci in senatu
hesterno die: Catilina ipse pertimuit, profugit. Hi quid exspec-
tant? Ne illi vehementer errant, si illam meam pristinam lenitatem
perpetuam sperant futuram.

IV. Quod exspectavi jam sum assecutus, ut vos omnes factam
esse aperte conjurationem contra rem publicam videretis; nisi vero
si quis est qui Catilinae similes cum Catilina sentire non putet.
Non est jam lenitati locus: severitatem res ipsa flagitat. Unum
etiam nunc concedam: exeant, proficiscantur, ne patiantur desi-
derio sui Catilinam miserum tabescere. Demonstrabo iter: Aurelia
via profectus est: si accelerare volent, ad vesperam consequentur.
O fortunatam rem publicam, si quidem hanc sentinam [hujus] urhis
ejecerit. Uno mehercule Catilina exhausto, relevata mihi et
recreata res publica videtur. Quid enim mali aut sceleris fingi aut
cogitari potest quod non ille conceperit? Quis tota Italia vene-
ficus, quis gladiator, quis latro, quis sicarius, quis parricida, quis
testamentorum subjector, quis circumscriptor, quis ganeo, quis

Aurelia via] This road went from Rome
through the west part of Etruria. It
touched the coast of Etruria at Alsium,
about twenty miles from Rome, and was

attributa‚] “Assigned as the field of
operations by Catilina.'’ Sallust (Cat. e. 27)
says that Catilina assigned Faesulae to
Manlius, and that part of Etruria; one

Septimius Camers had the Ager Picenus3
and C. Julius had Apulia. Muretus thinks
that C. Julius cannot be meant here, be-
cause Cicero is speaking of persons who are
still in the city; nor Manlius, for he had
long since gone to Etruria. But Cicero
does not mean that he saw all these men
before him.

superioris noctis] Of course he does not
mean the night immediately preceding. This
speech was delivered the day after the first
speech, as the words ‘hesterno die ³ show;
and in his first speech he exposed the de-
signs formed at the ineeting on a night be-
fore the day on which he made that speech.

Ne illi] ‘¹ The usual way of writing nae
seems to be found in no Ms.” (Halm.)

4. nisi vero si quis ess] Halm observes
that the use of ‘si’ after ‘nisi’ is rare in
Cicero, but established by sufficient exam-
ples. In this case he says that ‘nisi' has
exactly the force of an adverb, ‘except'
We also find ⁸ nisi si quis.' Halm (Orelli’s
edition) has ‘nisi vero [si] quis.’ Madvig
erasos ⁸ si.’

continued along the coast of Etruria through
Cosa to Pisae (Pisa), on the lower part of
the Arno. It was afterwards continued
along the coast from Pisae through Genua
to Forum Julii (Fre'jus) in Gallia.
subjecl0r‚] ‘Testamentum subjicere ’
means to forge a will, an expression which
Cicero uses (Philipp. xiv. 3) z ‘⁴ Testamenta,
credo, subjiciunt, aut ejiciunt vicinos, aut
adolescentulos circumscribunt.’' The notion
of knavishly puttiug the false for the true is
in this sense of ‘subjicere,' as it is in the
Greek ὑποβάλλεσθαι, ὑποβολιμαῖος. The
word ‘circumscribere,' ‘to draw a line
aroun(l‚’ expresses clearly the notion of
cheating (Vol. I. Verr. ii. 2. c. 61 ; Vol. II.
Pro Rosc. Com. c· 8). A Lex Plaetoria,
which Cicero mentions (De Off. iii. 15), had
for its object to prevent those under twenty-
five years of age from being cheaied : “ At-
que iste. dolus malus etiam legibus erat
vindicatus, ut tutela xli tabulis et circum-
scriptio adolescentium lege l'laet‹›1·ia;” where
some editions incorrectly have ‘ Laetoria)
Sallust (Cat⁴ c. 14) has given the same
picture of the vices of Catilina. We can-
