majores ante templum in ipso Matris magnae conspectu Mega-
lesibus fieri celebrarique voluerunt, qui sunt more institutisque
maxime casti, sollemnes, religiosi, quibus ludis primum ante populi
consessum senatui locum P. Africanus iterum consul ille major
dedit· ut eos ludos haec lues impura pollueret? quo si qui liber aut
spectandi aut etiam religionis caussa accesserat, manus affere-
bantur; quo matrona nulla adiit propter vim consessumque ser—
vorum. Ita ludos eos, quorum religio tanta est ut ex ultimis terris
arcessita in hac urbe consederit, qui uni ludi ne verbo quidem
appellantur Latino, ut vocabulo ipso et appetita religio externa et
Matris magnae nomine suscepta declaretur, hos ludos servi fece-
runt, servi spectaverunt, tota denique hoc aedile servorum Mega-
lesia fuerunt. Pro dii immortales! qui magis nobiscum loqui
possetis, si essetis versareminique nobiscum? ludos esse pollutos
significastis ac plane dicitis. Quid magis inquinatum, deformatum,
perversum, conturbatum dici potest, quam omne servitium permissu
magistratus liberatum in alteram scenam immissum, alteri prae-
positum, ut alter consessus potestati servorum objiceretur, alter

do not affirm that he did know what he
meant. After the Senatus populusque Ro-
manus turned out and the slaves taking

were celebrated on the Megalesia3 and yet
the Megalesia was the name of the Ludi.
Klotz explains it thus—these games (illi

 

ludi) were celebrated during those festival
days which were denoted by the general name
of Megalesia; for the Megalesia were cele-
brated for several days in succession. Ac-
cordingly the writer speaks first of the games
which were first celebrated at the Megalesia,
and then he speaks of other games (scenic)
celebrated at the ,Megalesia also.

The story of Scipio Africanus and the
Ludi is in Livy (34. c. 54): “Horum
aedilium ludos Romanos primus senatus
a populo secretus spectavit—Postremum
ipsum quoque Africanum, quod consul auctor
ejus rei fuisset poenituisse ferunt.'⁷ Here
the story is told of the Ludi Romani.

consessumque servorvm] It is one of
the characters of a good writer to tell a
story so that. it can be understood. At
these Ludi, which were spoiled by Clodius'
men, ‘¹ if any freeman had approached either.
for the purpose ofseeing or even as a religious
duty (the ‘etiam' is curious) hands were
laid on him; no ‘matrona' went near the
place because of violence and the slaves
being seated there.” In the preceding
chapter the Senatus and the Populus Ro-
manus were seated, and we must suppose
they were turned out and the slaves took
their place; a most unlikely thing, but he
means that if he means any thing, and I

their place, it seems a most ridiculous
thing to talk of ‘ quo si qui liber,’ &c.

Klotz remarks upon the words ‘quo si
qui liber,’ that the orator here returns to
his discourse, which has been interrupted by
several clauses, ‘ Nam quid ego de illis ludis
loquar3' and the passage rightly read does
not cause the slightest difficulty.

Faernus changed ‘pollueret' into ‘pol-
luerit) and Baiter has followed him. But
Klotz justly observes that ‘pollueret' is
right, for Cicero says sarcastically, he made
this arrangement in order that this impure
pestilence might pollute the Ludi.

versio, quasi ex Grammatici dictatis excepta.
Sed absona est haec ratio: Ludi vocabulo
appellantur peregrino, ut eos Magnae Matri
dicatos esse appareat. Videlicet, si statim
cogites θεὰν Μεγάλην ’' (Wolf). Igive the
answer of Klotz in the original: ·‘ Es war
doch bei Gott nicht so sehr schwer bei dem
XVorte Μεγαλὴσια an die μήτηρ μεγάλη
zu denken, wie Wolf annehmen mochte.

Cicero's.”

immissum, alteri praepositum.'
