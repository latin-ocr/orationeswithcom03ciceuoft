504 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

XXI. Victi essent improbi.—At cives, at ab eo privato, qui sine
armis etiam consul rem publicam conservarat. Sin victi essent
boni, qui superessent? nonne ad servos videtis rem publicam ven·
turam fuisse 3—A11 mihi ipsi, ut quidam putant, fuit mors aequo
animo oppetenda 3—Q11id, tum mortemne fugiebam? an erat res
ulla quam mihi magis optandam putarem? aut ego illas res tantas
in tanta improborum multitudine quum gerebam, non mihi mors,
non exsilium ob oculos versabatur? non haec denique a me tum
tamquam fata in ipsa re gerenda canebantur? an erat mihi in tanto
luctu meorum, tanta disjunctione, tanta acerbitate, tauta spoliatione
omnium rerum, quas mihi aut natura aut fortuna dederat, vita reti-
nenda? tam eram rudis, tam ignarus rerum? tam expers consilii
aut ingenii? nihil audieram? nihil videram? nihil ipse legendo
quaerendoque cognoveram? nesciebam vitae brevem esse cursum,
gloriae sempiternum? quum esset omnibus definita mors, optandum
esse ut vita. quae necessitati deberetur patriae potius donata quam
reservata naturae videretur? nesciebam inter sapientissimos ho-

observed that ‘ non ¹ should be erased, for
if it is absurdly added, wc do not say the
contrary to that which ought to be said,
but we say nothing at all. Cicero must
either fight it out and involve the state in
his danger, or take the risk on himself of
the danger which threatened all (Madvig).
There is no doubt about what is meant.
Orelli thinks that the analogy of the Greek
(μᾶλλον ῆ οὐ) and of the German language
justify the ‘non ;’ and he thinks that Wolf’s
translation is quite right: “hatte ich
kampfen lieber . . . als nicht das, was allen
drohte . . . erdnlden sollen.’⁷ Halm adds:
“adstipulatus est Orellio Klotz, satis ha-
bens ex Matth. grammatica, ad quam Orelli
provocaverat, aliquot exempla exscripsisse;
quae ut ipse invenire videretur, praeterea
Matthiaei grammaticam conferri jussit, quasi
in illa alia ab ipso nondum exscripta ex-
tarent ” (Halm). Halm compares Pro
Plancio c. 39: ‘⁶ cum tempestate pugnem
periculose potius quam illi salute praeser-
tim proposita obtemperem et paream.''

It is plain that there is no negation in
the second member of the sentence, but on
the contrary, there is the affirmation of
doing something; and the comparison is,
‘ should I have done this or that! But it
could also have been said, ‘should I have
done this, and not that ;’ and it is possible
that the negation in the second member
may be genuine, though it is a confused
way of speaking, for if it were added here

‘non . . . susciperem,' a man might read the
passage without observing the ⁴ non‚' as
many seem to have ‹lone; for Halm says
that Gesner is the only critic who has ob-
served that ¹ non ’ ought to be erased.

21. qui superessent Γ] ‘ Who would have
remained ?’ and then he answers the ques-
tion. ‘ Superessent ⁷ is preferable to the
reading ⁶ qui superesset.'

rem publicam venturam] The common
reading is ⁴ rem venturam‚’ as in the pas-
sage in the De Domo (e. 34), where Halm
proposes to read ‘ res publica venisset‚’ of
which Halm says “in quo loco est manifesta
hujus loci imitati0.’¹

res tantas] What he did in his consul-
ship.-‘ exsilium :’ Hotmann proposed ‘ ex-
itium,’ which Madvig and Wesenberg pre-
fer; but as Halm observes, Cicero means
to say that he foresaw in his consulship
that he might be driven from Rome at
some future time by the faction which was
opposed to him.

canebantur .?] A word used to express a
prophetie warning, as Manutius says, who
cites: ‘⁴ Quae tam multa nobis consulibus
facta sunt, ut haec quae nunc fiunt canere dii
immortales viderentur ’³ (In Cat. iii. 8).—
‘ natura aut fortuna :' nature gives children,
fortune gives property (Manutius).

ylariae] Compare Pro Cn. Rabirio, c.
10, Vol. ΙΙ., and the note on ‘gloria3’ also
Pro Archia, e. 10.
