POETA OAP. 4, 5. ‘217

ac fortunarum suarum Romae collocavit? An non est professus?

Immo vero iis tabulis professus, quae solae ex illa professione col-
legioque praetorum obtinent publicarum tabularum auctoritatem.
V. Nam quum Appii tabulae negligentius asservatae dicerentur,
Gabinii quamdiu incolumis fuit levitas, post damnationem calamitas
0111110111 tabularum fidem resignasset, Metellus, homo sanctissimus
modestissimusque omnium, tanta diligentia fuit ut ad L. Lentulum
praetorem et ad judices venerit et 'unius nominis litura se commo-
tum esse dixerit. His igitur tabulis nullam lituram in nomine A.
Licinii videtis. Quae quum ita sint, quid est quod de ejus civitate
dubitetis, praesertim quum aliis quoque in civitatibus fuerit ascrip-
tus? Etenim quum mediocribus multis et aut nulla aut humili
aliqua arte praeditis gratuito civitatem in Graecia homines imper-

audacissimus ego ex omnibus? Minime. where, and of course could nothe trusted.

At tanto officiosior? Ne istius quidem
laudis,'' &c. Baiter writes: ‘At 11011 est
professus.' But 110 does not say on what
authority. Ε. P. have ‘ Αῐι.1

prqfessio] ⁴ Profiteri ' is to give in one's
name, to make a return, as we call it (Vol.
I. Verr. ii. 3. 0. 48). ‘By virtue of that
declaration and the college of Praetores have
the authenticity of public 1·0001·(]5.1 The
eight praetores formed a collegium 111 0110
501150, like the Tribuni (Vol. II. Pro Quin-
tio, c. 7).

5. Appii] He was praetor B.c. 89. This
Appius was the father of P. Clodius, Cicero’s
enemy. There is an allusion to him 111 the
oration Pro Domo, c. 32.

Gabinii] P. Gabinius Capito. After his
praetorship he was prosecuted for Repe-
tundae and convicted (Vol. II. Divin. 0.
20). Halm remarks that the opposition of
⁸ calamitas ' and ‘ incolumis ⁷ shows that the
word was formed by a popular corruption
110111 ⁴ calamitas ’ (see Vol. ΙΙ. Verr. ii. 3,
c. 98, note on ‘ calamitas ’).

resiqnasseh] ‘ Resignare ’ means to take
off the seals, to unseal a testament when a
man dies.

“ Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.’'
(Horace, Ep. i. 7. 9.)

To take the seals off a thing before the time
is a fraudulent act. When the seals are off,
the thing may be falsified. Cicero means
that the condemnationi of Gabinius destroyed
his credit, and was the same thing as if you
took the scals off a testament or other in-
strument and left it open to the falsifier.
Gabinius was careless while he kept his re-
gisterS, and after his condemnation we may
suppose that they were left nobody knows

ln such a case the credibility of the regis-
ters depended on their safe keepiug and
their being in proper hands. Cicero does
not mean that the ‘tabulae’ were scaled.
Manutius says they were scaled with the
praetor's ring.

It does not appear what the facts were
about the ‘litura' or erasure which Metel-
lus found in a single name. Probably he
found in some ‘tabulae‚’ in some registers
of citizenship, an erasure of 0110 man's
name. He came to P. Lentulus, a praetor,
as it is supposed, and to the judices, from
which it appears that there was a trial, and
he showed that he was very much troubled
about the erasure of a single name. This
shows the man’s care about the acciu-acy of
the registers. This is enough for the pur-
pose. All the rest that the critics say is
guess.

Manutius defends the reading ‘in nomen,’
which he explains ‘contra nomen.' ‘No-
mine' is the reading of B.; ‘nomeu' of
G. E. A. Mommsen conjectures ⁴ nulla in
litura nomen.⁷ This is Latin, as 111 Verr. ii.
2. 0. 78: ‘¹ extremam partem nominis . . .
esse in litura.’¹

suevit ascriplus :⁹] ‘¹ Not ‘ sit ascriptus,'
because for the present the value of the
‘ascriptio’ had ceased, since these ‘civitates'
had become ‘municipia ' '’ (Halm).

yratuito] Some would read ‘non gravate.’
⁴ Gratuito ’ is plain: “ nullo eorum merito,
nulla aut humili arte'' (Manutius). We
may perhaps infer from this passage that
the people of Locri iu South Italy had also
given Archias the freedom of their city.
The critics are not agreed whether Graecia
means Greece Proper or Magna Graecia.
