526 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

XXXVI. Nihil neque ante hoc tempus neque hoc ipso turbu-
lentissimo die criminamini Sestium.—Atqui vis in foro versata est.
—Certet quando enim major? Lapidationes persaepe vidimus:
non ita saepe, sed nimium tamen saepe, gladios: caedem vero
tantam, tantos acervos corporum exstructos, nisi forte illo Cinnano
atque Octaviano die, quis umquam in foro vidit? Qua ex concita-
tione animorum? Nam ex pertinacia aut constantia intercessoris
oritur saepe seditio, culpa atque improbitate latoris commodo
aliquo imperitis aut largitione [proposita] ; oritur ex concertatione
magistratuum3 oritur sensim ex clamore primum, deinde aliqua
disces’sione contionis; vix, sero et raro ad manus pervenitur: nullo
vero verbo facto, nulla contione advocata, nulla lege recitata con-
citatam nocturnam seditionem quis audivit? An veri simile est,
ut civis Romanus aut homo liber quisquam cum gladio in forum
descenderit ante lucem, ne de me ferri pateretur, praeter eos qui
ab illo pestifero ac perdito civi jam pridem rei publicae sanguine
saginantur? Hic jam de ipso accusatore quaero, qui P. Sestium
queritur cum multitudine in tribunatu et cum praesidio magno
fuisse, num illo die fuerit? Certe non fuit. Victa igitur est caussa
rei publicae, et victa non auspiciis, non intercessione, non suffragiis,

pius, Clodius’ brother; for Clodius was a
private man now and a plebeian, his bro-
ther was a patricia-n and praetor. In c. 39
he hints at gladiators having been supplied
by the praetor (Manutius). The story is
told by Dion, 39. c. 7. Appius had the
gladiators for his kinsman Marcus’ funeral.
—‘ ut . . . arbitrarentur ε’ this, which is one
of the common formulae of the Latin 1311-
guage, is easily understood, but generally
ill translated, because we keep to the form
of the Latin language even when our own
stubbornly refuses to accommodate itself:
“ You remember, judices, on that day the
Tiber was filled with the bodies of our
citizens, the sewers were choked, the blood
was wiped up from the Forum with sponges,
which was enough to make every body con-
sider all those great means and magnificent
preparation, not private or plebeian, but
patrician and praetorian.'’

36. Cinnano atque Octaviano die,] In
Cat. iii. c. 10, and the note on Cn. Octa-
Vius.

Qua ex concitatione] ‘What was the
cause of this disturbance ?’ on the day which
Cicero has just described (0. 35). Τ1115
perhaps may be mistaken, sor Halm says
that Osiander supposed the words to refer

to the riot of Cinna and Octavius, which is
a very stupid mistake.

commodo aliquo] After these words
Halm (2) puts in ‘ oblato' of his own coin-
ing. In the editions since Naugerius there
is ‘ proposita ’ after ‘ largitione ;’ I suppose
without any MSS. authority. We can do
without either of them.

discessione] ‘ Division into parties}
Wunder and Orelli (2) propose ‘ dissensione‚'
which cannot be accepted. Halm refers to
Gellius ii. 12: “si ob discordiam dissen-
sionemque seditio atque discessio populi in
duas partes fieret;'' to the Quum Populo,
0. 3, “in discessu ;'’ and to the De Domo, c.
⁶26, where he thinks that we should read
‘ discessione hominum,’ sor he does not
think that ⁴ dissensio,⁷ as far as 110 0311 500,
0311 go with ‘ instituitur ς’ nor perhaps cau
we say ⁴ discessio instituitur.'

recitata concilotam] ‘⁴ ‘ conc-itata ' (om.
rec-it.) P.; ¹ recitata ’ (om. com-it.) G.’'
(Halm); who writes (2) ‘lege lata concita-
tam.’

An verisimile est, ut] See Pro Sulla,
c. 20, note.——‘ ipso accusatore :’ M. Tullius
Albinovanus. See the Preface.-—‘ non
auspiciisz’ not by an ⁴ obnuntiatio‚' of which
110 speaks in the next sentence.
