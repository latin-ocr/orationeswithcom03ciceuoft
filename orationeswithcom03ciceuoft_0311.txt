INTRODUOTION. 297

The external evidence for the genuineness of these orations is as good
as the evidence for any other orations of Cicer03 and it must be some
very strong reasons which can justify a declaration that they are spurious.
Wolf states the various matters on which a judgment of any writer
must be founded. We must examine his form of expression, the lan-
guage that he uses, the words severally and the way in which they are
placed. We expect to find a certain uniformity in a writer3 and we
do not expect an oration which passes under Cicero’s name to be so
different from his other orations that we perceive the difference as soon
as we begin to read it. N ext to the propriety of the language, we con-
sider the manner in which the matter is treated; the whole discourse,
and the connexion of the parts3 or as Wolf calls it “logicam veritatem
sententiarum sine qua ex verbis rectissime positis inanis et futilis
strepitus nascitur.” Or we may take Cicero’s own opinion: “tria
videnda sunt oratori, quid dicat, et quo quidque loco, et quomodo ”
(Orator, c. 13). In the third place, Wolf says, we must consider the
elegance and other rhetorical merits of the composition. Fourthly, we
come to the examination of historical mistakes. Cicero was not always
exact iu his statement of historical facts3 but we have to consider
whether he could make the mistakes which appear in these orations3 if
he could fall into such contradictions and make such exaggerations.
Indeed Wolf advises us not to take as true any thing in these orations,
unless it is supported by better authority. His remark applies par-
ticularly to the oration De Domo, which the jurisconsults have taken
as authority in some things which relate to their science. But, as he
says, there is no doubt that the writer used some orations of Cicero,
which are now lost, taking both the facts and the language ; which will
explain how it happens, that there are many parts in these orations
completely in the style of Cicero. Wolf further conjectures, and I
think it is a reasonable conjecture, that on examining the passages which
Asconius, Aquila, and Rufinianus have cited from the two last of these
orations and comparing them with the present text, we see that the
writer simply varied whole passages in his original, interpolated them,
and put them on the scholastic anvil. And he adds if this conjecture
shall not displease the learned, the number of the ancient authorities in
favour of these orations will be much diminished, since the orations De
Domo and De Haruspicum responsis, which Asconius, Quintilian, and
others cite, may not be those which we now have.

In the fifth place Wolf mentions a thing which is easier felt than
reduced to exact rules, “civilis prudentia quaedam.'’ We expect a

good remark on his perverse industry: “Melius hoc quam rescribere veteribus orationi-

bus, ut fecit Sestius contra Ciceronis actionem habitam pro Milone, quum alteram partem
satis nosse non posset ex sola defensione.’'
