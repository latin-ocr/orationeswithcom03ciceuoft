 

ORATION FOR P. SESTIUS. 473

and the disturbances at Rome which were caused by Clodius and his
partizans’ opposition to Cicero’s restoration. On the great day of the
25th of January, when Fabricius (c. 35) intended to propose to the
people a Rogatio for Cicero’s recall, Clodius and his 111011 attacked
Fabricius and his party3 many were killed, and Cicero’s brother Quintus
was severely wounded. Sestius was not present on that day. On
another day, trusting to his tribunitian office, he went to the temple of
Castor (c. 37) to stop some proceedings of the consul by the form of
Obnuntiatio, which he could legally do. Clodius' men fell on the
tribune and nearly killed him ; and it was not till he had suffered this
violence, that Sestius protected himself by keeping armed men about
him; and Milo did the same. Sestius only protected himself against
violence; and he was guilty of none.

The orator then (c. 45) enters on a kind of politica] discussion, which
he supposes to be profitable to those who heard him, and not altogether
foreign to the case: he explains the character of the two parties in the
Roman State which were severally called Populares and Optimates.

In this part of his speech he makes an attack on L. Gellius, one of
those who were to give evidence against Sestius (c. 51). And he
answers what the prosecutor of Sestius had said about Cicero’s recall to
Rome, and the way in which it had been accomplished (c. 60). He
ends with addressing the young men (c. 61), whom he exhorts to
defend the party of the Optimates; and with an appeal to the judices in
behalf of Sestius.

Halm’s argument.)

The edition of this oration in the second edition of Orelli's Cicero is
by Halm. The following are the MSS. to which he refers :—

A --- Lemmata Scholiastae Bobiensis (Cicero, Schol. p. 291, 800).

P = Codex Parisinus 7 794 a me collatus.

G = Codex Gemblacensis, nunc Bruxellensis 5345 a Baitero
collatus.

S z Codex Salisburgensis‚ nunc Monacensis Lat. 15734 a me col-
latus.

I have referred to this edition of Halm by the figure (2) ; and to his
earlier and separate edition of this oration, Leipzig, 1845, by the figure
(1). This separate edition contains a very copious commentary on the
oration Pro Sestio, selected from the notes of P. Manutius, N. Abramus,
Ferratius, and other scholars down to the present day3 to which the
editor has added many valuable notes of his own. This commentary is
much more copious than any commentary can be made in an edition of
