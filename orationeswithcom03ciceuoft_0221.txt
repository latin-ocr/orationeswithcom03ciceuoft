have accompanied Lucullus the father to Sicily3 for it was some time
after his arrival in Rome, says Cicero, that Archias accompanied Lucul-
lus to Sicily. Halm assumes that it was M. Lucullus the son, whom he
went with3 and he conjectures that this journey was connected with the
prosecution which L. and M. Luculli conducted against the augur Ser-
vilius (Plutarch, Lucullus, c. 1). L. Lucullus the father had been pro-
secuted for Peculatus or maladministration during his Sicilian praetor-
ship by Servilius, and had gone into exile.

On leaving Sicily with Lucullus, Archias went to Heracleain Lucania,
where he was admitted a citizen through the influence of Lucullus. It
is conjectured that Lucullus the father was living at Heraclea. But it
is just as reasonable to conjecture that he was living somewhere else.
This visit to Heraclea was before the Marsic war, as the narrative of
Cicero shows (0. 4). In Β.0. 89 the Lex Plautia et Papiria gave the
Roman ‘ civitas’ on certain conditions to all persons whose names were
at that time enrolled on the list of citizens in a Civitas Foederata.
Heraclea had a Foedus with Rome, and Archias who wished to become
a Roman citizen made the necessary declaration at Rome before his
friend the praetor Q Metellus Pius, and was admitted a Roman citizen.
After the fashion of Greeks who got the Roman ‘ civitas' through a Roman
patron, 110 adopted the Gentile name of his patron, and became A.
Licinius Archias. The new citizens were not enrolled 011 the Censors’
lists before the Census of Rc. 86, and Archias was then in Asia with
L. Lucullus, who was Sulla⁷s quaestor (c. 5). Again in ec. 70 Archias
was not entered on the Censors' lists, for he was in Asia with L. Lucul-
lus who was then conducting the war against Mithridates. In Bc. 65,
64 there was no census.

In Β.0. 62 a man named Gratius prosecuted Archias before the praetor,
who was, as the Scholiast says, Q. Cicero, Marcus’ brother, and under
the Lex Papia, which was directed against those who acted as if they
had the Civitas without being entitled to it. This fact appears from the
Argumentum publishcd by Mai. The motives of the prosecutor are not
mentioned by Cicero, but modern acuteness can discover them: “In
Archias his prosecutor attacked the protectors of Archias: it can scarcely
be doubted that the prosecutor, a man in other respects altogether un-
known, acted at the instigation of the Pompeiam party, which the year
before had sustained a defeat by the triumph of L. Lucullus '’ (Drumann,
Geschichte Roms, iv. 202).

Cicero defended Archias who had begun to write a poem on Cicero's
consulship3 and this was the reason, says Halm, though he does not say
how he knows it, that Cicero undertook the poet's defeuce‚ rather than
the reason which Cicero gives in the opening of his speech. A year
later Cicero says to Atticus (i. 16) : Archias has written nothing about
