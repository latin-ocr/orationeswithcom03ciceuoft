ORATIO DE DOMO. 347

Rome, no citizen can be driven from the city nor any thing done against
his ‘ caput ’ and property without the judgment of the Senate, or of the
Populus, or of those who are appointed J udices in each case. He also
shows why the tribunate of Clodius was no tribunate, his adoption not
having been made in legal form. In the third part he says that even if
Clodius was legally elected a tribune, he could not propose a Lex to
affect the ‘caput’ of a citizen who was not condemned, for that would be
a Privilegium which the Twelve Tables forbid. And this was not the whole
of the illegal proceedings, for Clodius had proposed and carried a Lex
which touched the ‘ caput' and the property of a man who had neither
been summoned to appear nor had been prosecuted. He shows also
that the terms of the Lex were faulty, being these : ‘⁴ Velitis, jubeatis,
Quirites, ut M. Tullio aqua et igni Interdictum Sit,” instead of the
verb being in the present tense ‘ Interdicatur.’ The charge also against
Cicero with respect to a S. C. was false: “ Falsum S. C. ab eo relatum
esse ;” and the Senate admitted the charge to be false by having restored
Cicero.

In the fourth part he refutes the abuse of Clodius, who had called
Cicero Exsul, for the name could not be applied to him either in respect
of any offence that he had committed, or because of a condemnation.
The unanimous consent of all classes by virtue of which Cicero had
been 'restored was a proof that he had done his country service, and had
done no wrong. He could not be called Exsul on the ground of a con-
demnation, for he left Rome untouched and uncondemned3 there was
no notice to him of any prosecution; and a Roman could not lose
either his liberty or his citizenship except by his own act. Fur-ther, in
the Rogatio of Clodius, there was nothing that deprived Cicero of his
Senatorial rank, and the Rogatio of Clodius was not carried by the
votes of the Populus, but by arabble of hired slaves, criminals and needy
people. In the fifth part he answers Clodius’ charges against him of
boasting of his services to the State3 and he answers those who made
his leaving Rome a ground of charge against him. In the sixth place he ψ
shows how Clodius had acted contrary to all justice and all regard to
religious ceremonial in the dedication of the ground on which Cicero’s
house stood. The dedication is proved to be irregular by the fact that
the College of Pontifices was not present, but one Pontifex only, an
‘affinis' of Clodius, a young man of no experience, induced by his
sister’s prayers, and his mother's threats, and that he performed the
ceremony in a disordered state of mind and with faltering tongue. In
the seventh and last place the orator appeals to Jupiter and the other
gods, and prays that if he had saved their temples from ruin, and in
defence of their sanctity had exposed himself to the fui-y of abandoned
citizens, they will permit him to be reinstated in the possession of the
