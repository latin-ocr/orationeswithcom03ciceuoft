166 ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

meum condiscipulum in pueritia, familiarem in adolescentia, colle-
gam in quaestura commemorabat fuisse; multa mea in se, nonnulla
etiam sua in me proferebat officia. Quibus ego rebus, judices, ita
flectebar animo atque frangebar ut jain ex memoria quas mihi ipsi
fecerat insidias deponerem3 ut jam immissum esse ab eo C. Gorne-
lium. qui me in aedibus meis, in conspectu uxoris meae ac liberorum
meorum trucidaret, obliviscerer. Quae si de uno me cogitasset,
qua mollitia sum animi ac lenitate⁷ numquam mehercule illius lacri-
mis ac precibus restitissem. Sed quum mihi patriae, quum vestro-
rum periculorum, quum hujus urbis, q'uum illorum delubrorum atquc
templorum, quum puerorum infantium, quum matronarum ac virgi-
num veniebat in mentem, et quum illae infestae ac funestae faces
universumque totius urbis incendium, quum tela, quum caedes,
quum civium cruor⁷ quum cinis patriae versari ante oculos atque
animum memoria refricare coeperat, tum denique ei resistebam,
neque solum illi hosti ac parricidae, sed his etiam propinquis illius,
Marcellis, patri et filio, quorum alter apud me parentis gravitatem,
alter filii suavitatem obtinebat3 neque me arbitrabar sine summo
scelere posse, quod maleficium in aliis vindicassem, idem in illorum

6. ut jam ex memoria] ‘ut jam‚' T. V.
‘ ut Spengelius conjecit.’ The other read-
ing is ‘ut etiam! But ‘ut etiam’ is as
easily explained as the ‘ ut jam.' It is hard
to say which is best. ‘Ut jam ex memo-
ria‚' and ‘ut jam immissum,’ correspond
well; and there is force in the repetition.
But ‘ut etiam ex men101·ia‚' followed by
‘ut jam immissum,' is also plain.

C. Corneliana] One of the men who
were sent to assassinate Cicero, as he says
(In Cat. i. c, 4). In that passage he names
neither of the men. In this and in c. 18
he only mentions C. Cornelius and not
Vargunteium and this he does, as Halm
supposes, to increase the unpopularity of
the family of C. Cornelius whose son was
Torquatus' subscriptor.

aedibus φηρὶ-9,] This is Lambinus’ con-
jecture in place of ‘sedibus meis.’ The
best MS. Pal. Non. (V.) has ‘meis sedim
bus? ⁴ Aedibus’ and ‘ sedibus ’ are easily
confoundcd.—‘ qua mollitia:’ ‘ such is my
yielding and gentle temper.' This is a usual
Latin form of expression, and elliptical—
‘quum inihi—veniebat in mentem τ’ com-
pare Vol. Ι. Divin. c. 133 Vol. 11. Pro P.
Quintio, c. 23 Pro Sex. Rosc. Am. c. 34.

(mimum memoria refricare] Latin inc-
taphors arc the difficult pari of the language.
First we have to find out what they meany
which may generally be donc3 and then wc

have to find an equivalent expression, which
very often we cannot find. In other pas-
sages of Cicero ‘ refricare ' is applied to rub-
bing an old wound or sore. Hence it is
used metaphorically to signify the bringing
something to remembrance which gives
pain. All the things which Cicero men-
tions were brought back to his remem-
brance by the presence and importunity of
Autronius, Halm proposes this as a trans-
lation: “ to tear open afresh the wounds of
my beart which were scarcely healed over.'’
But if this is the best translation that his
language can offer, I can only say that it is
bad. In another passage Cicero says (Phil.
iii. 7): “ illam pulcherrimi facti memoriam
refricat.'' Tne notion is to ‘rub' generally,
to arouse, to excite by rubbing. In the
passage of the Philipp. it is the ⁸ memory ⁷
which is rubbed up and roused, or the re-
membrance rather3 a form of expression
which we have taken from the Latin. In
this passage it is the burnt ashes of his
country and many other things which are
before the eyes and rouse the mind, the
feelings, by aid of the memory.

sslareelli.r,] These Marcelli, father and
son, are supposed to bc C. Marcelli. The
elder was Praetor of Sicily, r..c. 75), and
vii-cro praises the equity of his admini=z1 ra-
tion (Vei-r. ii. 2. c. 21). llis son was con-
sul ωε. 50.
