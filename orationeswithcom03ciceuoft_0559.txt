is not necessary. He compares Pro Flacco,
c. 4: ‘⁴ sed sunt in illo numero . . . multi
imprudentes,'’ &c. 3 where ‘sed sunt’ refers
to ‘multi imprudentes.¹ And here, he

thwarted by the popular vote, when they or
their friends being candidates were rejected
by the people (Manutius). It might 1131111011
that their will was also thwarted in the ‘ 00-
mitia ' for the enactment of Leges (Halm).

ne quid peccasset] These Optiinates
were very scrupulous men. as Cicero re-
presents them, really ‘graves et magni
homines! They suspected that popular
” 31111131150, if they ever got it, was given them
for something of which they ought to be
ashamed. This is a useful hint. Abrami,
who in his collection of tons of matter has
a few pearls mixed with the rest, quotes
a passage of Plutarch (Apophtheg. p. 188).
It is 3 saying of Phocion, a wise man : ‘⁴ On
one occasion when 110 was speaking be-
fore the people‚ being well received, and
seeing that all of them were readily taking
1115 words, he turned round and said to his
friends: Surely I must by mistake have
said something bad.’' And a saying of
Antisthenes to the like effect is recorded by
Diogenes Laert. vi. l: πρὸς τὸν εἰπόντα
Πολλοί σε ἐπαινοῦσι. Τι’ γὰρ, ἔφη, κακὸν

ceived! Compare Pro Caelio, c. 19; Ad
Att. xiv. 12: “ sed nos, nisi me fallit,
jacebimus.”—‘ operas conductorum! Muel-
ler and Madvig think that ‘conductorum ‘
is a gloss, for ‘ operae ’ are the hirelings of

v01.. 111.

Clodius, and we can no more say ‘operae
conductorum ’ than ‘homines Romanorum.'
If ‘ operae' corresponded 10 ⁴ homines ' the
objection of Madvig would be good, but,
as Halm observes, it is an abstract noun.
‘Operae' in the sense of ‘operarii ’ does
not differ at all from ‘ virtus ’ for ⁴ vir fortis ;’
nor, as Halm says, does ‘operae conducto-
rum ’ differ from ‘ copiae peditum,' ‘ auxilia
popularium,' and similar expressions. Halm
also compares De Domo, 0. 30 : ‘⁶ conductis
operis non solum egentium sed etiam ser-
vorum ;'' and Varro De R. R. i. 17 : ‘⁶ cum
conducticiis liberorum operis res majores ut
vindemias et foenisicia administrant.'’

locis] Manutius thought that ‘ locis ’
meant ⁴ places‚’ the Forum, the Campus, the
Theatrum. Halm thinks that it means ⁶ 011
three occasions ' (bei drei Gelegenheiten) ;
and there is no doubt that it does.

nonposset f] The MSS. have not ‘nom’
It was added by Lambinus. Klotz does
not accept the ⁴ non‚' and he gives this
translation of the passage: “What popu-
lar assembly was held during these years,
an assembly, I mean, not hired, but a real
assembly, so that one could recognize in it
the unanimous judgment ot' the Roman
people?'' He says that the words ‘in qua
populi . . . posset’ contain merely an ex-
planation of the adjective ⁴ vera‚’ and must
not be taken as an appendage 10 1110 whole
sentence. If the ‘ non ' is not accepted, we
must of course take Klotz's explanation.
Cicero begins by saying that the real opinion
of the Roman people 0311 110 ascertained at
the ⁴ contiones.' lf 110 then said what
Klotz supposes 11131 110 said, lic would say
that all the ‘contiones ' ‘per hos annos '
were hired and bribed. Thcn he would
say that all the gladiator-’s ‘ contiones ’ ((10
