M. TULLII CICERONIS

IN

L. CATILINAM

ORATIO SECUNDA,

AD QUIRITES.

I. TANDEM aliquando, Quirites, L. Catilinam, furentem audacia,
scelus anhelantem, pestem patriae nefarie molientem, vobis atque
huic urbi ferro flammaque minitantem, ex urbe vel ejecimus vel
*emisimus vel ipsum egredientem verbis prosecuti sumus. Abiit,
excessit, evasit, erupit. Nulla jam pernicies a monstro illo atque
prodigio moenibus ipsis intra moenia comparabitur. Atque hunc
quidem unum hujus belli domestici ducem sine controversia vicimus.
Non enim jam inter latera nostra sica illa versabitur3 non in
campo, non in foro, non in curia, non denique intra domesticos
parietes pertimescemus. Loco ille motus est quum est ex urbe
depulsus. Palam jam cum hoste nullo impediente bellum justum

l. Tandem aliquando‚] Cicero, in one of
his letters to Atticus (i. 14), mentions a
speech of Crassus in the Senate, in which
Crassus spoke in this same magniloquent
style of the services that Cicero had ren-
dered to his country in his consulship; and
he adds: “Quid multa? Totum hunc lo-
cum, quem ego varie meis orationibus, qua-
rum tu Aristarchus eS, soleo pingere, de
flamma, dc ferro—nosti illas ληκύθους-
valde graviter pertexuit.'¹

J'erroflammmsne] This is the reading of
three of Halm’s best MSS. The distinction
between ‘ferrum flammamque’ and ‘ferro
flammaque' is, as Madvig says, that the
ablativa denotes the instrument or means.
Cicero uses the ablative with ‘minitari' in
other passages (Philipp. xi. 14; xiii. 21).
Klotz quotes from Cicero (Tuscul. Dispnt.
i. 43) : “ cui quum rex Lysimachus crucem

minitaretur ς’ and he says that ‘ crux ' more
distinctly expresses the death on the cross
than if Cicero had used ‘cruce.’ But Ι
cannot see that-⁴ vel—vel—vel :' the ora-
tor gives his hearers the choice of any one
of the three expressions.

verbis prosecuti snmus] ‘ Prosequi ' is
often used with an ablative. Itis a word
that expresses the following of a man, the
accompanying him a certain distance. Here
the meaning is fixed by ‘verbis,' ‘we ac-
companied him with our words3’ which
appear to refer to the first oration, as Halm
thinks. Other explanations have been given.

bellum justum] ‘ Justum ' is omitted in
three good Mss.; but I see no reason for
rejecting it; for though Cicero says ‘⁴ we
shall now carry on the war with our enemy
without any hin‹lranee‚” there seems some
propriety in saying ‘bellum justum,' or ‘a
