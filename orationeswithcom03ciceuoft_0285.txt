OAP. 28—30. 271

miseriores habes quam aut Mithridates, aut etiam pater tuus habuit
umquam? Cur his per te frui libertate sua, cur denique esse liberis
non licet? Homines sunt tota [ex] Asia frugalissimi, sanctissimi, a
Graecorum luxuria et levitate remotissimi, patresfamilias suo con-
tenti, aratores, rusticani: agros habent et natura perbonos, et dili-
gentia culturaque meliores. In hisce agris tu praedia habere
voluisti. Omnino mallem, et magis erat tuum si jam te crassi agri
delectabant, hic alieubi in Crustumino aut in Capenati paravisses.
Verum esto; Catonis est dictum: Pedibus compensari pecuniam.
Longe omnino a Tiberi ad Caicum ς quo in loco etiam Agamemnon
cum exercitu errasset, nisi ducem Telephum invenisset. Sed con-
cedo id quoque: placuit oppidum: regio delectavit: emisses.
XXX. Amyntas est genere, honore, existimatione, pecunia prin-
ceps illius civitatis. Hujus socrum, mulierem imbecilli consilii,
satis locupletem, pellexit Decianus ad sese; et quum illa quid age-
retur nesciret, in possessione praediorum ejus familiam suam collo-
cavit: uxorem abduxit ab Amynta praegnantem, quae peperit
apud Decianum filiam, hodieque apud Decianum est et uxor
Amyntae et filia. Numquid harum rerum a me fingitur, Deciane?
Sciunt haec omnes nobiles, sciunt boni viri, sciunt denique nostri
homines, sciunt mediocres negotiatores Exsurge, Amynta: re-

Apollonia in Mysia and also Apollonis. nec minus etiam C. Servilii Glauciae multa
Apollonia was on a height east of Pergamum improbe seditioseque committeret ε quam

on the road to Sardis. There was a ridge
of hills south of Apollonia ; and after cross-
ing tbe hius and going by the road to Sardis,
Thyatira was on the left and Apollonis on
the right, distant from Sardis 300 stadia,
and the same distance from Pergamum
(Strabo, p. 625). The site of Apollonis is
uncertain, but it is supposed to be repre-
sented by a village named Bullene. The
Greek ethnic name is Ἀπολλωινιδης, and
the Roman name should be Apollonidensis.
In the editions of Pliny (v. c. 30) the name is
written Apollonidienses.

Cicero says that Decianus avoided the
great towns where the governor often was,
and kept himself in those places, where
tranquillity was not maintained by the pre-
sence of the Romans.

miseriores habes] ‘ Why do you plague
them more than.' The father of this De-
cianus is supposed to be the man who is
mentioned in the oration Pro C. Rabirio, c.
9. There is the following note on Decianus
(Schol. Bob. in orat. Pro Flacco, p. 230, ed.
Orelli): ‘⁸ Et hic subscriptor suit Apulaei
Deciani filius, jam nuper damnati, quum tr.
pl. esset, et in ultionem Apulaei Saturnini

tamen damnationem passus in Pontum se et
ad partes Mithridaticas contulit. Quo ipso
infamiam generis ejus perstringit orator3
ut imitatus quodammodo patrem omnia pro
hostibus sentire videatur.”

Pedibus compensari] It is not easy to see
what old Cato meant, when he said that
⁶ money 01· profit was compensated by walk-
ing.’ It is a long way from the Tiber to
the Caicus of Mysia, and I suppose that land
would be bought there eheaper, but if a man
thus gained in money, he must pay in trouble.
If we had Cato’s saying with the matter to
which it applied, we should no doubt readily
see the meaning.

Ayamemuon] This frigid stuff is ex—
plained, as it is said, by the commentary of
Eustathius on the Iliad (i. 59), quoted by
Manutius. Agamemnon and his men in
their invasion of Asia lost the way and got
into the country os the Mysian king Tele-
phus, who opposed them and was wounded
by Achilles, Telephus had his wdund cured
by Achilles, and he rcpaid the service by
showing the Greeks the way to Troy.—
‘ emisses :' ⁴ emisse dcbebas‚' as Manutius
explains it.
