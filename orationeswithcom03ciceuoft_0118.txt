104 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

nobilitas, Servi Sulpici, tametsi summa est, tamen hominibus litte-
ratis et historicis est notior, populo vero et suffragatoribus obscu-
rior. Pater enim fuit equestri 100ος avus nulla illustri laude
celebratus. Itaque non ex sermone hominum recenti, sed ex anna-
lium vetustate eruenda memoria est nobilitatis tuae. Quare ego
te semper in nostrum numerum aggregare soleo, quod virtute
industriaque perfecisti ut, quum equitis Romani esses filius, summa
tamen amplitudine dignus putarere: nec mihi umquam minus in
Q. Pompeio, novo homine et fortissimo viro, virtutis esse visum est
quam in homine nobilissimo M. Aemilio. Etenim ejusdem animi
atque ingenii est posteris suis, quod Pompeius fecit, amplitudinem
nominis quam non acceperit tradere3 et, ut Scaurus, memoriam
prope intermortuam generis sui virtute renovare. VIII. Quam-
quam ego jam putabam, judices, multis viris fortibus ne ignobilitas
objiceretur generis meo labore esse perfectum; qui non modo
Curiis, Catonibus, Pompeiis, antiquis illis, fortissimis viris, novis
hominibus, sed his recentibus, Mariis et Didiis et Caeliis comme-

lz'tleratz's] The word ‘litterae’ had the
sense which we give to the word ‘letters ’
in the phrase ‘man of letters ;’ and ‘litte-
ratus' is used by Cicero to signify a man of
education, such as people had in his time:
‘⁴ Canius nec infacetus et satis litteratus”
(De Off. iii. 14).

‘ Historia,’ a Greek word first used by
Herodotus (i. l), was now established in
the Latin language, pretty nearly in the
sense that we have; but the notion of His-
tory is somewhat vaguely conceived. ‘ His-
toricus ' was established 'in Cicero’s time as
the word that expressed ‘historiae scriptor.’
(De Or. ii. 14.) Cicero (De Or. ii. 12) has
some remarks on history.

Pater] The Gens Sulpicia is said to have
been Patrician, but as Cicero tells us, Ser-
vius was the son of an Eques, and his
grandfather was a man of no note. This is
all that we know of the family of this dis-
tinguished man. He was probably born
B.c. 105 01· 104, and so was a year or so
younger than Cicero, who calls him ‘aequa-
lis ’ (Brutus, c. 40). lt is reckoned that.
he was quaestor iu 13.c. 74, aedile in 13.c.
(39, and praetor in 13.c. (55. He was not
elected consul till 13.c. 51.

annalium vetustate] Cicero (De Or. ii.
12): “Erat enim historia nihil aliud nisi
annalium confectio, cujus rei memoriaeque
publicae retinendae caussa, ab initio rerum
Romanarum usque ad P. Mucium Ponti-
ficem Maximum, res omnes singulorum an-
norum mandabat literis pontifex Maximus

referebatque in album et proponebat tabu-
lam domi, potestas ut esset populo cogno-
scendi; iique etiam nunc Annales Maximi
nominantur.'' See Vol. I. Verr. ii. 4. c.
52, note on Annales.

in nostrum numerum] Cicero was of the
equestrian class (municipalis eques). Q.
Pompeius is the man of whom he says
(Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 5. c. 70, and the note)
“humili atque obscuro loco natus.'' M.
Aemilius is Scaurus, who was twice consul
(B.c. 115 and 107), 311(1 raised from its low
estate a family which belonged to the an-
cient Aemilia Gens. Cicero gives him a -
good character. Sallust, who knew him, ‘'
and did not like him, does not speak well
of the man (Jugurtha, c. 15).

8. qui-jacebant] He mentions well-
known names of men who had risen to the
highest places. C. Marius is the most con-
spicuous of the three recent names that he
mentions; and Cicero’s countryman. The
construction in this sentence may be a diffi-
culty. Matthiae compares another passage
in Cicero (De Off. i. 2): ‘⁶ Quis est enim
qui nullis officii praeceptis tradendis philo-
sophum se audeat dicere ?” The form in
‘ —dus ’ 15 not very easy to understand. It
seems sometimes to be a kind of present
participle, if we use the language of gram-
marians. The passage in the text means:
“these men, though they could cite the
names. 1 speak not of the Curii, Catones,
Pompeii, those men of ancient times, men
of the greatest merit, and the first to enno-
