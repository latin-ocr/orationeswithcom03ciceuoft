100 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

clausos esse oportere. Etenim si me tua familiaritas ab hac caussa
removisset, et si hoc idem Q. Hortensio, M. Crasso, clarissimis
viris, si item ceteris, a quihus intelligo tuam gratiam magni aesti-
mari, accidisset3 in ea civitate consul designatus defensorem non
haberet, in qua nemini umquam infimo majores nostri patronum
deesse voluerunt. Ego vero, judices, ipse me existimarem nefarium
si amico, crudelem si misem, superbum si consuli defuissem.
Quare quod dandum est amicitiae, large dabitur a me, ut· tecum
agam, Servi, non secus ac si meus esset frater qui mihi est carissi-
mus isto in loco. Quod tribuendum est officio, fidei, religioni, id
ita moderabor ut meminerim me contra amici studium pro amici
periculo dicere.

V, intelligo, judices tres totius accusationis partes fuisse, et
earum unam in reprehensione vitae, alteram in contentione dignita-
tis, tertiam in criminibus ambitus esse versatam. Atque harum
trium partium prima illa„ quae gravissima debebat esse, ita suit
infirma et levis ut [illos] lex magis quaedam accusatoria quam vera
maledicendi facultas de vita L. Murenae dicere aliquid coegerit.
Objecta est enim Asia, quae ab hoc non ad voluptatem et luxuriam
expetita est, sed in militari labore peragrata3 qui si adolescens

addition of ‘ rivulos3' and Moebius trans-

was the first part. The second was the
lates it: ‘⁴ do not insist on my small know-

‘comparison of merit' in the rival candi-

]edge of law being refused to my friends,
while you do not refuse your abundant
learning even to your enemies3⁷’ and he
adds ‘a fine irony.' Fine indeed3 as if
Cicero meant 10 compare his legal know-
ledge, of which he had little and to which
he made no pretensions, with the great
acquirements of Sulpicius, which he knew
how 1ο value. (Introduction.)

Q. Hortensio, M. Cras-sm] They had
spoken before Cicero, 10 whom they left
tho peroration, as was done on other 0003-
sions: “Tum Brutus, Quid 111, inquit,
quaeris alios? de 10 ipso nonne quid opta-
rent rei, quid ipse Hortensius judicaret
videbamus? qui quum partiretur tecum
caussas, saepe enim interfui, perorandi lo-
cum, ubi plurimum ponet oratio, semper
tibi relinquebat⁷⁷ (Cicero, Brutus, 0. 51.
Compare Pro Balbo, c. 7).

isto in [οι-0.] This should mean in 1110
place where you are, the prosecutors’. Ma-
nutius mistook the meaningg he says “in
hac dignitate consulari.'’

5. tres lolius] We should make only
one charge in such a case, for the man was
only accused of bribery. But his past life
was also reviewed by the prosecutors ; this

dates, ‘ contentio diguitatis’ (compare c. 73
and c. 9, ‘de dignitate contendas'). He
says 11131 1110 first part of the charge was so
feeble that the prosecutors were rather com-
pelled by a kind of rule established in pro-
secutions (lex quaedam accusatoria) 10 con—
form to this practice, than because they
really could say any thing against Murena.
There is a passage from the oration Pro
Caelio (c. 3): “Sed aliud est maledicere,
aliud accusare. Accusatio crimen desiderat,
rem ut definiat, hominem ut notet, argu-
mento probet, teste confirmet. Maledictio
autem nihil habet propositi praeter contu-
meliam, quae si petulantius jactatur convi-
cium, si facetius urbanitas nominatur.''

Objeeta est—Asia,] The seat of luxury,
the corrupter of the Romans (Vol. II.
Asu). The form of expression seems sin-
gular, but it is intelligible; “Asia is made
a charge against him;'’ as in the oration
Pro Fonteio, 0. 20 (Vol. II.): “ Primum
objicitur contra istorum impetus Macedo-
nia;’' but in that passage Macedonia is
produced in defence of the accused. In
c. 8 of this oration there is the common use
of 1110 word, ‘nc ignobilitas objiceretur!
