552 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

tuos ludos adspexit in illo ardenti tribunatu suo nec ullos alios nisi
eos, a quibus vix vivus effugit. Semel, inquam, se ludis homo
popularis commisit omnino, quum in templo Virtutis honos habi-
tus esset virtuti, Gaiique Marii, conservatoris hujus imperii, monu-
mentum municipi ejus et rei publicae defensori sedern ad salutem
praebuisset.

LV. Quo quidem tempore, quid populus Romanus sentire se
ostenderet utroque in genere declaratum est: primo, quum audito
senatus consulto rei ipsi atque absenti senatui plausus est ab uni-
versis datus; deinde, quum senatoribus singulis spectatum e senatu

redeuntibus.

Quum vero ipse qui ludos faciebat consul assedit,

stantes et manibus passis gratias agentes et lacrimantes gaudio

suam erga me benevolentiam ac misericordiam declararunt.

At

quum ille furibundus incitata illa sua vecordi mente venisset, vix
se populus Romanus tenuit; vix homines odium suum a corpore

signifies pretty nearly the same as the
French word ‘entrechats,’ seems to have
hinted also at something indecent (Halm.)
I do not know whether Halm means to say
that an ‘entrcchat' in itself is indecent;
nor am I aware how he knows that this
sprightly lady made ‘entrechatsff How-
evcr there is nothing iudecent in an ‘en-
trechatz’ “espece de saut leger pendant
lequel on croise rapidcment les deux pieds a
plusieurs reprises” (C. Nodier, Vocabulaire
de la Langue Francaise).

psaltria] The old story of the Bona Dea
and Clodius getting into Caesar’s house in
the dress of a female lute—player (De Ha-
rusp. c. 21). Comp. Juven. vi. 3:36.

via: vivus] On the day on which the
SCtum about Cicero's return was made in
the Templum Virtutis, the ‘ ludi’ were cele-
brated, to which Clodius came after the
Senate had ended their sitting (Manutius).

intemplo Virtutis] A.. ‘virtu**s honoris '
P., ‘ honoris ’ G. Halm (l) has ‘in templo
Virtutis-Honoris,’ the reading of the Erf.
MS. perhaps. In (2) he 1133 the reading
in the text. C. Marius erected a temple to
Virtus or to Honos, or to Virtus and Honos,
somewhere about the Capitol. The Mo-
numentum Marii is mentioned in the
Scholia to the Pro Plancio, c. 32, where it
is called ‘templum Honoris et Virtutis)
Cicero (De Divin. i. 28) mentions the SCtum
about his restoration being made in the
Monumentum Marii. A passage in Festus
(p. 344, Mueller) also speaks of this temple
of Honos and Virtus ε “ Summissiorem aliis
aedem Honoris et Virtutis C. Marius fecitne,
si forte officeret auspiciis publicis, augures

eam demoliri cogerent.’' There are also two
passages of Vitruvius (iii. 2, 53 Praef. l.
vii. 17) which speak of this temple of Honos
et Virtus (Becker, Handbuch‚ &c. i. 405).

The evidence is in favour of the 1131116
being Honos et Virtus or Virtus et Honos;
and Cicero's play on the two words is 111
favour of this reading, as Garatoni remarks.

It was the fashion, says Abi-ami, for the
Senate to assemble in some place nearest to
the theatre, where the representations were
going on, in proof of which he refers to
Appian, B. C. ii. 115. 011 this occasion the
temple of Virtus and Honos received the
Senate: “illo SCto, quod in monumento
Marii factum est, quo mea salus omnibus
est gentibus commendata’' (Pro Plancio,
c. 32). The building erected by C. Marius
was the place in which Cicero his fellow-
townsman (municeps) found a place of safety.

55. utroque in yenere] ‘ ln both ways 3’
in their demonstration of affection to the
Senate, and of hatred to Clodius.

rei ipsi] This is 311 emendation of Ga-
ratoni and Dobree, a very obvious emenda-
tion of the corrupt reading ‘ore ipsi!—
‘ consul z’ P. Lentulus. The aediles curules¹
had the superintendence of the ‘ludi so-
lemnes,’ except the Apollinares, which were
directed hythe Praetor Urbanus, and ac-
cordingly the ‘ludi’ here spoken of are
supposed to be ¹ dedicatorii ’ 01· ‘ funebres '
(Halm).

stantes et] G„ ‘ stantes ei' P. Halm (l)
has ⁴ stantes et‚’ with the remark that We-
senberg has done right in preferring this
to the other reading. But in (2) he has
changed his mind, and 116 1133 ⁴ stantes ei.'
