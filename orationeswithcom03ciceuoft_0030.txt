Halm eorrectly explains it. ‘ Quem ad
fine1n‚’ ‘up to what li1nit‚' that is, ‘ quam-

ii. 5. e. 2!)): ‘⁶ Pii-atam vivum tenuisti?

concursus] Quintilian (lnst. ix. 3. 30),
who quotes the passage from ‘nihilne’ to
‘ m‹)verunt‚' has ‘eonsensus.' and also one
MS. of Cicero3 but ‘concursus’ is the
better reading. —‘ munitissimus :y the Senate

delive1·ed; a night immediately preceding

riore). Again (c. 4) he speaks ofthis ‘nox
superior‚¹ which he shortly after calls *pri0r3'
and this was the night on which the con-
spirators niet at Laeea’s house. The ‘nox
proxima’ is therefore the night of the se-
venth of November. and this speech was
delivered on the eighth of November. In
the second oration (c. (j) he also speaks of
one night intervening between the meeting
