256 ORAT. PRO L. VALERIO FLACCO

protulissent, criminis nihil erat: si falsas, erat poena. Bellissimum
putaverunt dicere amissas. Quiescant igitur, et me hoc in lucro
ponere atque aliud agere patiantur. Non sinunt. Supplet enim
iste neseio quis, et privatim dicit se dedisse. Hoc vero ferri nullo
modo potest. Qui de tabulis publicis recitat 115, quae in accusa-
toris potestate fuerunt, non debet habere auctoritatem3 sed tamen
judicium fieri videtur, quum tabulae illae ipsae cuicuimodi sunt pro-
feruntur. Quum vero is quem nemo vestrum vidit umquam, nemo
qui mortalis esset audivit, tantum dicit, DEDI, dubitatis, judices,
quin ab 1100 ignotissimo Phryge nobilissimum civem vindicetis?
Atque huic eidem nuper tres equites Romani honesti et graves,
quum in caussa liberali eum qui asserebatur cognatum suum esse
diceret, non crediderunt. Qui hoc evenit, ut, qui locuples testis
doloris et sanguinis sui non fuerit, idem sit gravis auctor injuriae
publican Atque hic Dorylensis nuper quum efferretur magna
frequentia consessuque vestro, mortis illius invidiam in L. Flaccum

Laelius conferebat.

in lucro ponere] ⁴ To put it to my pro-
fit,’ to reckon as so much on our side.
Horace says “adpone 1ucro.’' So Terence

(Phormio, ii. 3. 16) says:

“Quidquid practer spem eveniet, omne
id deputabo esse iu lucro.’'

in accusatoris potestate] The value of
written evidence depends on the hands out
of which it comes. If these ‘ tabulae pub-
11030 ’ were 111 the hands of the prosecutor,
he might have altered them or forged others,
if there was no check on him. Cicero adds:
“but still there is some show of a trial,
when these written documents themselves,
such as they may be, are produced.” But
when a man of whom we know nothing
says, ⁴ Ι gave the men evidence ¹ 111 writing,
that is nothing at a11.—-‘ cuicuimodi,' Schiitz.
Baiter has ‘cujuscunquemodi,' from Lam-
binus. S. T. A. have ‘ cujuscemodi,' and
F. has ‘cujusque modis We know that
‘cuicuimodi' will do. See Vol. I. Verr.
ii. 5. c. 41.—‘ dubitatis :’ ⁴ dubitabitis,’ Bai-
ter.

caussa liberali] A case 111 which a
man's freedom was in question. See Vol. Ι.
1)111111. c. 17. The Roman equites who
sat as Recuperatores in this 0350, did not
believe the man’s evidence—A ‘locuples
testis ’ is a credible witness. (Vol. Ῑ. Index.)
Baiter 1135, ⁶ Qui 1100 0001101111,7 the conjoc-
turc of Gulielmius, and a good one. But 1
suppose that all the MSS. have ‘eve11it,⁷ and

Facis injuste, Laeli, si putas nostro periculo

I see no difficulty in it. ⁵ Quod minime con-
venit ’ 15 appropriately used in 0. 19.

efferretur] ⁴ Haec ferertur,’ V. Baiter
does not say what the rest have. He quotes
⁴ ecferretur ’ as on the authority of Lambi-
nus. Faernus also has ‘ eeferretur.’ All
the MSS. have ‘ consensu ' in place of ‘ con-
sessu.’ It seems that the man died sud-
denly in court, and was carried out. In
Terence (Andria i. 1, 90) there is

⁴⁴ Effertur: imus.'’

1 do not see what Cicero means by 1115
frigid joke‚ ‘qui arborem numquam vidis-
set.’ There is a reading ‘arborem fici!
The man came from Phrygia, part ot' which
was a treeless country, and hence called
AxyIOS. Laelius threw him 3 basket of figs,
as one would throw them to a hog, and he
ate them like 3 hog. Klotz informs us
that a man who was not accustomed to
eating figs, should have been caresul in 1115
use of them. Perhaps they were dried,
hard figs; for 35 to fresh figs, the learned
commentator may be assured that he may
eat his fill of them without any danger.
The Scholiast, a man of taste, says this is very
fine: “valde summa cum festivitate dis-
cussit inridens veneni criminationem, quod
1110 videretur 1111115 dc numero accusatorum
Flacci repentina morte defunctus. Causa
interposita cst aviditatis ct intemperantiae
barbari hominis, quem poma inusitata
distendcrint.”
