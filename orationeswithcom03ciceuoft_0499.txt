OAP. 6, 7. 485

auspiciis, alligatam more majorum, constrictam legum sacratarum
catenis, solvit subito lege curiata consul, vel, ut ego arbitror,
exoratus, vel, ut non nemo putabat, iratus, ignarus quidem certe
et imprudens impendentium tantorum scelerum et malorum. Qui
tribunus plebis felix in evertenda re publica fuit, nullis suis nervis :
qui enim in ejusmodi vita- nervi esse potuerunt hominis fraternis
flagitiis, sororiis stupris, omni inaudita libidine infamis Z—sed fuit
profecto quaedam illa rei publicae fortuna fatalis, ut ille caecus
atque amens tribunus pl. nancisceretur—quid (licam Z—consulesss
hocine ut ego nomine appellem eversores hujus imperii, proditores
vestrae dignitatis, hostes bonorum omnium? qui ad delendum
senatum, affligendum equestrem ordinem, exstinguenda omnia jura
atque instituta majorum se illis fascibus ceterisque insignibus
summi honoris atque imperii ornatos esse arbitrabantur. Quorum,
per deos immortales! si nondum scelera vulneraque inusta rei
publicae vultis recordari, vultum atque incessum animis intuemini.

he means when he speaks of the consul
(Caesar) by a Lex Curiata letting loose a
monster ‘which was bound by the auspiceS,
tied fast by the custom of our ancestors,
bound by the chains of the leges sacratae!
Generally he means to say that this mon-
ster was chained by old usage and law, and
was let loose by being adopted into a ple-
beian family, which qualified him to be
elected a tribunus pl. 1 do not think that
either Manutius or Ferratius has explained
this passage correctly. ‘Alligatam more
majorum’ is explained by Manutius thus:
No Lex forbade a patrician being made a
plebeian, but very few patricians were made
plebeian33 and accordingly the ⁴ mos majo-
rum ' opposed Clodius' adoption. But the
‘mos majorum' is something positive3 a
rule that must be observed.

leyum sacratarum] Festus S. v. p 318,
Mueller. ‘⁴ Sacratae leges sunt quibus
sanctum est, qui quid adversus eas fecerit,
sacer alicui deorum sit, ut familia pecu-
niaque.” In iis hoc sancitum erat, ne cui
patrum capere tribunatum liceret (Halm).

consuh] This is Caesar. He did not do
this in his capacity of consul, but as Ponti-
fex Maximus, for the Comitia Curiata were
under the direction of the Pontifices (Gel-
lius, v. 19). ⁴ Subito’ is explained by a
passage in Suetonius. Compare De Domo,
c. 16, and the note on ‘ ad quosdam viros.'
¹ Lege curiata ' is an emendation of Turne-
bus. P. has ‘legum curiata‚' but ta ex-
punged; G. has ⁴ legum!

iratus‚] ‘Iratus ’ A., ‘ miratus’ P. G.‚

‘mihi iratus’ Halm (l); but in (2) he
omits ‘mihil perhaps better. ‘Miratus’
perhaps means ‘mihi iratus.' Still Cicero
seems to allude to Caesar having taken
offence at what he said at the trial of C.
Antonius (De Domo, c. 16).

fraternis flayiliis‚] vThe critics do not
agree which brother Cicero meant. The
Scholiast knew. It was Appius. We should
not care to know if we could. Cicero may
have meant both or either. He cared
nothing about the truth of what he said.

sororiis stupris‚] This is a foul charge
often repeated by Cicero, who says (Ad
Fam. i. 9): ‘⁶ primum ille fur muliebrium
religionum, qui non pluris fecerat Bonam
Deam quam tres sorores.’' The eldest Clo-
dia married Q. Marcius Rex, consul 13.c.
68. The second Clodia was the Quadran-
taria and βοῶπις of Cicero (Pro Caelio, c.
265). She married Q. Metellus Celer, con-
sul B.c. 60. The third Clodia was the wife
of L. Lucullus, consul B-C. 74. See Index,
¹ stuprum.'

infamis .7] Halm (l), who quotes Wesen-
berg’s argument in favour of ‘infamis ’ and
against the MSS. reading ‘insani.’ He
adds that the old editions have ‘ infamis.'
‘⁸ sed etiam libro Nuernbergensi, ubi est ‘in
fanis! ’' But iu (2) he has ⁶ insani' with this
remark ‘ insani P. corr. ex insane! Koechly
conjectured ‘ exhausti.' Hermann, cited by
Halm, asks what objection there is to say-
ing ‘ flagitiis insanum!

equestrem ordinem] He alludes to L.
Lamia, c. 12.
