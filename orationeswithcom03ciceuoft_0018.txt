Ro. 63. Two of them were Catilina and C. Antonius. Another was
Cicero, whose chance of success was not great, notwithstanding his
persona] character and his eminenee as an orator, for all the nobility
were opposed to him. Catilina and Antonius combined against Cicero,
who answered this coalition by an address to the people, entitled Oratio
in toga candida habita. Only a few fragments of this speech have been
preserved with the coininentary of Asconius, but enough to show that it
was a violent invective against the coalition (coitio) of Catilina and An-
tonius. This speech however did not serve Cicero so well as one of the
conspirators unwittingly did. Among Catilina’s associates was one
Q. Curius, a man who had been expelled from the Senate, one of those
idle, vain fellows who must talk, even if they ruin themselves by it.
He had long had for his mistress a woman of noble rank, ,named Fulvia3
but as his poverty did not allow him to give her what he had done, the
woman began to be dissatisfied. As he could no longer pay in ready
money, he paid in promises. He even threatened her life if she refused
her usual favours, and displayed a violence of behaviour that she had not
seen in him before. Fulvia found out the cause of Curius’ strange
behaviour, and talked freely about Catilina’s designs, without saying
how she knew them. The conspiracy was no longer a secret. The
danger gave Cicero the votes of all those who wished for tranquillity and
not revolution, and the nobility in alarin supported the elec-tion of the
upstart (novus homo) against the patrician revolutionist (Sallust, Cat.
c. 23). Cicero and Antonius were elected consuls for Rc. 63; but
Antonius only gained his electiori by a majority of a few centuriae.
After the loss of his election, Catilina was tried under the Lex Cor-
nelia de sicariis for a murder committed during Sulla’s proseription3 and
he was acquitted (Cicero, In Toga Candida, p. 91, ed. Orelli). His
disgrace and his danger increased his violence. He began to get stores
of arms in convenient parts of Italy; and by his own and his friends’
credit to raise money, which he sent to Faesulae in Etruria, to one
Manlius, an old centurion in Sulla’s army, who was himself a soldier of
fortune, a man of expense, an insolvent, and a revolutionist. He now
began to associate with him men of all classes and women too, for the
women had their share in the conspiracy. An historian who has often
preserved some valuable facts, which others have forgotten (Appiam,
B. C. ii. 2), says that Catilina got money from women who were tired
of their husbands and wanted an opportunity to murder them. There
may have been meu too who wished for the sanie opportunity to get rid
of their wives. There were solue women in the plot who had kept up
an extravagaut style of living by prostituting their bodies. Their profits
declined as they grew older, bnt their love of good living did not
diminish, and they got deep in debt. Catilina relicd on these women
