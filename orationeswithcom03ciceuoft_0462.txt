448 ORAT. DE HARUSPIOUM RESPONSIS

servorum totus esset? Si examen apium ludis in scenam venisset,
haruspices acciendos ex Etruria putaremus: videmus universi re-
pente examina tanta servorum immissa in populum Romanum
septum atque inclusum, et non commovemur? Atque in apium
fortasse examine nos ex Etruscorum scriptis haruspices ut a ser-
vitio caveremus monerent. Quod igitur ex aliquo disjuncto diverso-
que monstro significatum caveremus, id quum ipsum sibi monstrum
est, et quum in eo ipso periculum est ex quo periculum porten-
ditur, non pertimescemus? Istiusmodi Megalesia fecit pater tuus,
istiusmodi patruus? Is mihi etiam generis sui mentionem facit,
quum Athenionis aut Spartaci exemplo ludos facere maluerit quain

apium] C., ‘apu1n‚’ Orelli. Now we
come to his beautiful antitheses ‘swarm of
bees ' and ‘swarm of slaves.' We can
always foresec what the inan is going to do.
llis business is to oppose words to one
another. Markland says that ‘universi ' is
an idle word, and that if the man had
written ‘ pauci‚' it would have done just as
well. On which Gesner seriously observes
that a wonderful thing or a crime is certainly
greater, if it is seen by all than if there is no
witness of it. He did not see that Mark--
land ineant that neither ‘universi' nor
‘pauci ’ was the proper word: but that the
inan wrote so that if for one of liis words
you put another, it would fit his talk
equally; and this is the greatest condemna-
tion of a writer. But Klotz has a word to
say ; “ If a swarm of bees on the stage had
shown itself among the assembled people‚
it would not have been so generally seen, as
if whole masses of slaves fell upon the
popular assembly.’' An ingenious sug-
gestion. A swarm of bees if it remained
stationary might not be seen by all the
spectators, but if the bees flew about, they
would soon disperse the people, and would
be more felt than seen. The writer has
unfortunately omitted the antithetic equiva-
lent of ‘ universi ’ in the first member ofthe
sentence.

Wolf does not think that it was at this
time the fashion to summon Haruspices
from Etruria for such trifles; on which
Klotz observes that Wolf took this too
seriously.

disjuncto diversoque monstro] This ‘ dis-
junctum diversumque monstrum' is the
swarm of bees, which is ‘disjunctum’ be-
cause the sign and the thing signified (ser-
vitium) are not together. ‘Disjunctum'
may mean this, but ‘diversum' has no
meaning at alh—‘quum ipsum sibi mon-

strumz’ when the slaves are their own
‘ monstrum ’ (sign), when the ‘monstrum‚’
the sign, and the words signified are one.
There is not a more disgusting bit of idle
talk in the whole compass of written lan-
guage.

paler tuus,] Nothing is known of Clo-
dius’ father Appius having been Curule
Aedile, and he could not superintend the
Megalesia, if he was not aedile. In the
Pro Plancio (c. 21) Cicero says: “Vidit
enim pater tuus Appium Claudium, nobilis-
simum hominem, vivo patre suo potentis-
simo et clarissimo civi C. Claudio, aedilem
non esse sactum et eundem sine repulsa
factum esse consulem.’' The proper con-
clusion from this passage is that he never
was aedile. Garatoni's way of reconciling
the statement in the Pro Plancio and in
this oration is this: when Cicero says that
Appius was not elected aedile in his father’s
lifetime, he means that he was elected aedile
after his father's death3 and when he says
¹ eundem sine repulsa factum esse consulem)
he means that he was indeed aedile, but
after his rejection. This is very poor.
Drumann (Geschichte Roms, ii. 184) states
that Appius was afterwards made aedile, but
he has no authority except this passage3
and he observes in a note that as Wolf held
the whole oration to be spurious, he ac-
cordingly doubted about the accuracy of
this statement here about the aedileship.
C. Claudius Pulcher the uncle was aedilis,
and he celebrated games with great magni-
ficence, B.c. 99 (Vol. Ι. Verr. ii. 4. c. 3;
De Off. ii. 16). “Mox observanda est
transitio ad tertiam personam Is milli etc.
hoc loco certe molesta, quum eodem spiritu
oratio) redeat ad personam secundam '’

Athenionis . . . Spartaci] Athenion,
who headed the slaves in Sicily (Vol. I.
