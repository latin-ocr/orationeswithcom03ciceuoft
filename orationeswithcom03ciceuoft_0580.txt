566 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO
ejus quem sua lege et suo beneficio ornatum, munitum, armatum solet
gloriari, O. Caesaris legem de pecuniis repetundis non putat esse
legem? Et aiunt alios esse qui acta Caesaris rescindant, quum haec
optima lex et ab illo socero ejus et ab hoc assecula negligatur?
LXV. Et cohortari ausus est accusator in hac caussa vos, judices,
ut aliquando essetis severi, aliquando medicinam adhiberetis rei
publicae. Non ea est medicina, quum sanae parti corporis scalpellum
adhibetur atque integram carnificina est ista et crudelitas: ii me-
dentur rei publicae qui exsecant pestem aliquam tamquam strumam
civitatis,

Sed ut extremum habeat aliquid oratio mea, et ut ego ante di-
cendi finem· faciam quam vos me tam attente audiendi, concludam
illud de optimatibus eorumque principibus ac rei publicae defenso-
ribus; vosque, adolescentes, et qui nobiles estis, ad maj0rum
vestrorum imitationem excitabo, et qui ingenio ac virtute nobili-
tatem potestis consequi, ad eam rationem, in qua multi homines
novi et honore et gloria floruerunt, cohortabor. Haec est una via,
mihi credite, et laudis et dignitatis et honoris: a bonis viris sapien-
tibus et bene natura constitutis laudari et diligi; nosse discrip-
tionem civitatis a majoribus nostris sapientissime constitutam qui

sua leqe . . . ornalzmn] Vatinius tr. pl. jokes of Cicero on Vatinius are recorded by
proposed in 13.c. 59 the Lex which gave to Plutarch (Cicero, c. ⁴26> : ‘⁴ As to Vatinius,
C. Caesar the Province of Gallia Cisalpina who had tumours in his neck, and was on

and Illyricum for five years with three
legions. The Senate added to his com-
mission Gallia Comata and a fourth legion
(Sueton. Jul. c. 22). fearing that if they
did not give this to Caesar, the people
would.

illo socero] This was L. Calpurnius
Piso. whose daughter, Calpurnia, was Cae-
sar's last wife. “Shortly after (the mar-
riage oan. Pompeius and Caesar’s daughter
Julia) Caesar married Calpurnia, the daugh-
ter of Piso, and got Piso named consul for
the next year (ac. 58), though Cato in this
matter also strongly protested‚ and exclaimed
that it was an intolerable thing for the
chief power to be prostituted by marriage
bargains, and that they should help one
another by means of women to provinces
and armies and political power’' (Plutarch,
Caesar, c. 1⁴). There was a Lex Julia de
Repetundis‚ enacted in Caesar’s consul-
ship. Manutius refers to the oration De
Prov. Cous. c. 4, and In Pison cc. 12, 16.

65. tamquam strumam] An allusion to
Vatinius' personal defmmity, as in the
In Vatin. c. 163 in Att. ii. 9. This was
Cicero's disgraceful practice. Two personal

one occasion pleading a cause, Cicero called
him a tumid orator ;'’ and again (c. 9):
“Vatinius was a man whose manner was
somewhat rough and contemptuous towards
the magistrates when lie was pleading be-
fore them, and his neck was full of swell-
ings: on one occasion when he was before
Cicero he made a certain demand, and as
Cicero did not grant it forthwith, but de-
liberated some time, Vatinius said that he
should not hesitate about it, if he were
praetor, on which Cicero quickly answered,
‘But Ihave not such a neck as you.’''
Cicero's joke turned on the word ⁴ cervices‚’
of which use there is an example in the
Verr. ii. 3. c. 59 ι “qui tantis erunt cervi-
cibus recuperatores qui audeant 3⁷¹ and 5.
c. 423 and in this oration, c. 66.

nobiles . . . homines novi] See Vol. I.,
Index.—‘ bene natura constitutis :' men who
have a good natural disposition, ‘un bon
naturel‚’ as our neighbours say. Orelli
entirely mistook this simple passage, which
Halm explains right.

discriptionem] P. G.; ‘ descriptionem,'

the forms of ‘ discribere,' though it is often
