ORATION FOR P. SULLA. 157

bought again. He began this trade when his kinsman Sulla was selling,
and six and thirty years after, says Cicero, he was at the same dirty
work again (De Off. ii. c. S). Sulla died in Rc. 45, somewhere out of
Rome. Cicero writes to Cassius (Ad Div. xv. 17) to tell him that
P. Sulla, the father, was dead3 some said he was killed by robbers,
others that he died of a fit of indigestion; the people cared not which,
for it was certain he was dead and burned. He says that Cassius will
bear the loss of such a distinguished man like a philosopher, but he
supposes that Caesar will be afraid that his sales of confiscated property
will not go on so well. Cassius (Ad Div. XV. 19) answered Cicero in
the same strain: he says that Sulla’s judgment must be approved, for
seeing that philosophers differed, he did not trouble himself about what
was good, but he bought up all goods (non quaesiit quid bonum esset,
sed onmia bona coemit) : an allusion to his indifference to philosophy, and
his love of money. He adds, Caesar will not be in want of a purchaser
at his auctions when he has seen the son. So the son was like the
father, a greedy Roman. Once more, in a letter to Dolabella (Ad Div.
ix. 10), Cicero says that the people were very much concerned about
Sulla's death until they knew whether it was so or not3 but they gave
over troubling themselves about the manner of it, when they were
assured of the fact. ‘⁶ In other respects,’' says Cicero, “ Ι bear it like a
philosopher: Ι am only afraid that Caesar's sales will cool.'' Sulla
had joined the man whom Cicero and Cassius hated, and Cicero's abuse
of those of the opposite party, or those with whom he had quarrelled,
is no great evidence against them. It is only as an indication of Cicero's
character that we take any interest in what he says of Sulla. It is not
only possible, but it is probable‚ that Cicero could truly say that Sulla,
was not in Catilina’s conspiracy3 at least we may believe that there was
no evidence against him. Sulla was, as it seems, a greedy, cunning
man, ready to make the most of any opportunity to enrich himself, but
too prudent to risk his fortune in a desperate undertaking. If Catilina
had succeeded in his designs, Sulla would have bought at his auctions,
as he did in his younger days, when the Dictator Sulla offered the pro-
perty of the proscribed, and as he did again in his old age, when Caesar
brought into the market the estates of his enemies.

This oration is in the second part of the new edition of Cicero’s
orations by Baiter and Halm. It is revised by Halm.
