ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

Etsi hoc factum a Murena

omnino, judices, non est, ab ejus amicis autem more et modo
factum est, tamen admonitus re ipsa recordor qnantum hae eon-
questiones in senatu habitae punctorum nobis, Servi, detraxerint.
Quod enim tempus fuit aut nostra aut patrum nostrorum memoria.
quo haec sive ambitio est sive liberalitas non fuerit, ut locus et in

circo et in foro daretur amicis et tribulibus?

several tribes, and the people were all in-
vited to eat and drink.'’ We do not know
how the treating was done; whether the
inns were opened‚ or the people sat down
under tents, or ¹sinder porticos or in spa-
However no doubt there were
plenty of innkeepers and others ready to
provide the feast for the money. Cicero
merely denies that Murena treated: he
admits that his friends did; and it was a
good old fasliion. We have statutes against
treating electors. The 7 and 8 William III.
c. 4 is called the Treating Act. It forbids
the candidate after the date of the writs, or
after the ordering of the writs, or after any
vacancy to give money or entertaininent to
his electors, or promise to give any in order
to be elected under pain—of what? being
incapable ofserving for that place in par-
liament. What could be more gentle? The
honourable candidate did not give. Some
Natta gave for him. This act was found
insufficient to prevent treating3 and it re-
quired the experience ot* all the time from
the reign of william ΙΙΙ. to the reign of
Victoria to make the discovery. The 5 and 6
Victoria, c. 102, a very virtuous aot, goes
further (ξ 2⁴2), and in verbose and heavy
words threatens the candidate, or person
elected, if he “ shall by himself or by or
with any person. or in any manner directly
or indirectly give or provide or cause or
knowingly allow to be given or provided
wholly or partly at his expense, 01· pay
wholly or in part any expenses incur-red for
any meat, drink, entertainment‚ or provision
to or for any person at any time either be-
fore, during, or after such electiori, for the
purpose of corruptly influencing such person
or any other person to give or to resrain
from giving his vote in any such election, or
for the purpose of corruptly rewarding such
person or any other person for having given
or refrained from giving his vote at any
such election—he shall be incapable of being

elected or sitting for the particular county,
&c., during the parliament for which such
election shall be holden.'' What would
Cicero have said to all this rubbish? So
careful is the legislator that he even forbids
treating after an election, when the purpose
is to induce a voter to give a corrupt vote
at the election. Yet after all the pains the
legislator has taken, Natta does the job for
the candidate, and treats and bribes, and
when inquiry is made, Natta is proved to
be the guilty man, and the candidate is so
innocent that he knows nothing of it. Natta
is generally Nobody.

hae conquestiones] He seems to mean the
talk in the senate and the complaints made
about such matters as led to the Senatus
consultum3 and he says that ⁴ we,' all of us,
my client and yourself Servius lost votes by
this talk and inquiry. The people were
displeased and would not vote. ‘ Punctum '
is a vote (Pro Cn. Plancio. c. 22), for the
voters pricked on the tablet the name of
the candidate for whom they voted, as the
passage in Festus (v. Suffragatores) seems
to mean.

“Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile
dulci.'' (Horace, Ars Poet. v. 343.)

in foro] The old fashion was to exhibit
the gladiators in the Forum. There was no
amphitheatre in Rome at this time. The
people saw the fights from scaffoldings and
balconies (maeniana). Plutarch (C. Grac-
chus, c. 12) says: ¹‘ The people were going
to see an exhibition of gladiators in the
Forum, and most of the magistrates had
constructed seats round the place, with the
intention of letting them for hire. But
Caius urged them to remove the seats, that
the poor might be able to see the show
without paying.” Compare Livy, 23. c. 30;
31. c. 503 Cicero, Pro Sestio, c. 583 Pro-
pertius, iv. 8. 763 references of Becker,
