M. TULLII CICERONIS

DE HARUSPICUM RESPONSIS

IN sENATU ORATIO.

I. HESTERNo die, patres conscripti, quum mc et vestra dignitas et

frequentia equitum Romanorum,

quibus senatus dabatur, magno

opere commosset. putavi mihi reprimendam esse P. Clodii impu-
dicam impudentiam, quum is publicanorum caussam stultissimis
interrogationibus impediret, P. Tullioni Syro navaret operam,
atque ei se cui totus venierat etiam vobis inspectantibus vendi-

taret.

Itaque hominem furentem exsultantemque continui simulac

periculum judicii intendi: duobus inceptis verbis omnem impetum

gladiatoris ferociamque compressi.

l. Romanorum] Baiter adds ‘praesen-
tium.'-——‘impudicam impudentiam? Mark-
land thinks that Cicero would not havejoined
these words. Ι do not know if ever he did.

P. Tullioni Syro] Perhaps some man
connected with the Publicani of Syria, and
himself a Syrian. Wolf refers to Cicero
Ad Q. Fr. ii. 13 : ‘⁴ eodem igitur die Tyriis
(Syriis) est senatus datus frequens: fre-
quentes contra Syriaci publicani.'' But the
date of this letter is fixed at A.U.c. 700 in
some editions.—‘ vobis inspectantibus:' a
favourite expression with the Declamator.

duobus inceptis verbis] Markland finds
fault with this. Gesner defends it, and
asks, “Quidni sic dicere potuit Tullius
eadem sententia qua deinde (c. 4) ‘tantum
attigi legum initium?y ’' Wolf has a good
note here. He says that what is properly
said is easily distinguished from that which
is said without due care; some expressions
occur only once; others are altogether
against the analogy of the language. He
who considers such things unworthy of a
good author, judges right; and he judges
wrong who thinks that whatever is found
in an old Latin writer, is for that reason

Attamen ignarus ille qui con-

consistent with the best Latinity. If any
one denies that a writer has elsewhere used
an expression which we find in him, he
who would answer thisv must take the trou—
ble to find a contrary instance. And he
continues: “Atque hoc quidem saepe non
admodum difficile est, et merus labor digito-
rum: at subtilior res est ipsam linguae
analogiam exquirere, et quid ea ferat, quid
respuat, judicare. Ita aio recte scribi, attin-
ρετ-ρ initium leqis, etsi numquam me id
legere memini : contra Latine dici incipere
verba ausim negare, nullo libro inspect0.''
Attamen] “Vix exputo quid sibi velit
hoc allanze7z'’ (Wolf). It means nothing.
Nor the words ‘ignarus ille qui consules
essent’ It is true they mean that Clodius
⁴ did not know what kind ofconsuls Lentulus

and Metellus' were, and how unlike they x

were to his dear Gabinius and Piso, the
consuls of the year of his tribuneship. But
though this by itself expresses a fact, it has
no connexion at all with the sentence.
The only possible connexion is this, that
knowing the character of the consuls he
hurried out of the ‘ curia ’ with threats, but
threats which were no longer formidable.
