ORATIONS AGAINST CATILINA. 15

have said that the last three orations against Catilina are not genuine.
Cicero (Ad Att. ii. 1, 2) mentions among his ten ⁴ orationes consulares'
four against Catilina (septima, qua Catilinam emisi; octava, quam habui
ad populum postridie quam Catilina profugit3 nona in contione quo die
Allobroges involgarunt3 decima in Senatu Nonis Decembribus). It
has been supposed until the present century that the four orations
which we have are the four of which Cicero speaks in this letter. The
evidence of the MSS„ as far as it goes, is for the genuineness of these
speecheS. They are not attributed to any body else than Cicero.
Those who read them attentively may discover if they can, either in the
matter or in the language, the signs of forgery. If a man who is
familiar with Cicero can read these orations without any suspicion of their
genuineness, that is a good argument in their defence. It is likely
enough that there are interpolations in them3 but they are as genuine
as any thing else that we have of Cicero. It is very difficult for a man
to read the two books of the Epistolae ad Brutum without feeling that
heis not reading Cicero. Drumann has two long notes (p. 470, and
512) in which he maintains that all these four orations are genuine.

I have used Halm’s edition of these Orations, which is in the new
edition of Orelli's Cicero. He has given the various readings at great
length. I have also used his edition of these four orations with German
notes (Leipzig, 1851), and Ι have got much useful matter from it.
