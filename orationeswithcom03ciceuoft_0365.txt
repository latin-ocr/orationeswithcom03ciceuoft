DE DOMO

SUA

ORATIO

AD PONTIFICES.

I. QUUM multa divinitus, pontifices, a majoribus nostris inventa
atque instituta sunt, tum nihil praeclarius quam quod eosdem et
religionibus deorum immortalium et summae rei publicae praeesse
voluerunt, ut amplissimi et clarissimi cives rem publicam bene
gerendo, religionibus religiones sapienter interpretando rem pub-

licam conservarent.

l. Quum mulla . . . conservarent] The
reading which Wolf and others have is this:
‘ gerendo, pontifices religiones sapienter in-
terpretando! C. has ‘gerendo religiones
religionibus sapienter,’ which is corrupt.
Halm has made out of it ‘gerendo reli-
giones, religionum jus sapienter,’ comparing
‘jus religionum ³ (c. 2). This is ingenious,
and Baiter accepts it. Klotz corrects or
rather alters it thus, ‘ gerendo religiones,pon-
tifiees religiones sapienter! Wolf says he has
no doubtthat this is the meaning: ‘⁴ Praeclare
instituerunt majores nostri, ut Pontifices
nunquam non simul sint Senatores, ita ut
iidem, duplicem personam sustinentes, par-
tim sententiis dicendis, partim religionibus
interpretandis, rei publicae utilitati consu-
lant.'’ Wolf observes that it is a false
assertion‘that no man except a senator
could be a Pontifex, or, as it is also said,
that only men of senatorian rank could be
Cicero says
(Ad Att. iv. 2) : ‘⁶ Habetur frequens Sena-
tus; adhibentur Pontifices omnes, qui
erant Senatores :'' and the same thing is
said De Harusp. c, 7. Klotz denies that
there is any contradiction between this pas-
sage and that from the letter to Atticus and
the passage in the De Haruspicum. He
affirms that the writer does not say that all
who were not senators were excluded from

Quod si ullo tempore magna caussa in

the Pontificate, but that it is a good thing
that they, in the majority, not exactly all,
should be at the same time senators and
priests, and that this union of two offices in
the same persons was not prevented by the
old constitution, but allowed, and perhaps
found in many respects desirable or even
fixed by mle—But this is a false expo-
sition, a perversiori of the meaning. He
addresses the Pontifices, and says that it
was the will of our ancestors that the same
persons should have the care of religion and
of the state. If there had been no college
of Pontifices, we should conclude that the
senate had the care of religion. As there
was a college of Pontifices smaller in num-
ber than the senate, we conclude that every
Pontifex was a senator, or what is the same
thing, only a senator could be a Pontifex.
This is what he says; and it is false. Klotz’s
emendation does not alter this fact; and his
emendation is bad in all respects.

There is a list of the Pontifices in the De
Haruspicum ResponsiS, c. 6. The Pontifex
Maximus, C. Julius Caesar, was absent in
Gallia, where he had been cutting the
Nervii to pieces this year (3.0. 57), and
selling fifty thousand prisoners of the
Aduatuci, a people of Belgium (B. G.
lib. ii.).
