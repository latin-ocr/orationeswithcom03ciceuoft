536 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

utendum. Vim volumus exstingui: jus valeat 11909556 est, id est
judicia, quibus omne jus continetur. Judicia displicent aut nulla
sunt: vis dominetur necesse est. Hoc vident omnes: Milo et
vidit et fecit ut- jus experiretur, vim depelleret. Altero uti voluit,
ut virtus audaciam vinceret: altero usus necessario est, ne virtus
ab audacia vinceretur. Eademque ratio fuit Sestii, si minus in
accusando—neque enim per omnes fuit idem fieri necessa—at
certe in necessitate defendendae salutis suae praesidioque contra
vim et manum comparando. ’

XLIII. O di immortales! quemnam ostenditis exitum nobis?
quam spem rei publicae datis? quotus quisque invenietur tanta
virtute vir, qui optimam quamque caussam rei publicae amplecta-
tur, qui bonis viris deserviat, qui solidam laudem veramque quaerat?
quum sciat duo illa rei publicae paene fata, Gabinium et Pisonem,
alterum haurire quotidie ex pacatissimis atque opulentissimis
Syriae gazis innumerabile pondus auri; bellum inferre quiescenti-
bus, ut eorum veteres illibatasque divitias in profundissimum
libidinum suarum gurgitem profundat; villam aedificare in oculis
omnium tantam, tugurium ut jam videatur esse illa villa, quam ipse
tribunus plebis pictam olim in contionibus explicabat, quo fortis-
simum ac summum civem in invidiam homo castus ac non cupidus

q Vim volumus] This is not an unusual
form of expression: “Suppose 01 If we

would 113116 violence extinguished, law
must prevail‚ that is, the administration of
justice, which comprehends all 13111.”
Again: ‘⁴ Suppose or Ifwe will have no ad-
ministration of justice, or there is none,
force must of necessity rule.'’ Cicero’s re-
mark contains nothing new; but he has
said well what he intends to say. The
purity of the courts of laW, the impartial
administration ofjustice, as prompt as pos-
sible, at as small 3 0051 35 possible, is the
simplest and the surest test of a well-con-
stituted state. It is 50 great a blessing that
even despotism with it may be tolerable3
and without it liberty, then falsely so called,
is intolerable.

‘ haec.' But ⁴ hoc’ refers to 311 that has
preceded as one thing.—‘ et fecit ut jus
experiretur:' a well—known periphrasis for
‘ expertus est,’ but more appropriate here
on account of the antithesis (Halm).

P. G. have ‘hoc3’ S. has

“ Stare simul casu Trojae duo fata videres:
Hinc puer Aeacides, hinc Jove natus
erat.'’

He also refers to the expression De Prov.
Cons. c. l: “Gabinium et Pisonem duo
rei publicae portenta 30 1136116 funera.''
He calls ‘paene’ an adverb, which per-
forms the part of an attribute3 and refers
to De Domo, c. 57, “in illo paene fat0,”
where the word is well used. He should
have referred to otherexamples (Quum Sena-
tui, e. 15, note), which would show the
difference between Cicero and his ape.
villam] At Tusculum. See De Domo,
c. 47, where we are told what it was built
out of. Gabinius was trib. pl. in B.c. 67.
Τ119 ‘illa villa' seems to be the ‘villa ’ of
Lucullus, of which Gabinius showed the
Romans a picture in order to make them
comprehend the wealth and extravagance of
the man whom he was attacking. Gabinius
did this when he was proposing the Lex for
giving Pompeius the command against the
pirates (Introd. to the Dc Imp. Cn. Pom-
