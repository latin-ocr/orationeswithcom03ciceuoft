reflections. “ The historians of the middle
class, who are the most numerous, pervert
us all. They aim to chew the morsels for
us; they make it a law to themselves to
judge of, and consequently to bend the his-
tory to their own fancy3 for while the judg-
ment leans on one side, the writer cannot
avoid turning and winding his narrative ac-
cording to that bias.'' (Montaigne‚ Essays,
ii. c. 10.)

In c. 3 Cicero only names the Luculli.
He purposely does not name the father.
In B.c. 0⁴2, when this oration was delivered,
we may assume that Lucullus the father
was dead. L. Lucullus the son was now
in Rome enjoying the wealth that he got in
Asia. It is very natural that the orator
should speak of him or his brother without
any description: but it is very unlikely
that he would speak of the praetor of forty
years past without distinguishing him from
his sons who were then alive. and in Rome.

Heraclea] The foedus between Heraclea
and Rome dated from the time of King
Pyrrhus (Pro Balbo, e. 22). “The father
of L. Lucullus probably lived at Heraclea
in exile‚’' says Halm. (See the Introduc-

ῃοιέἐία est civitas] Before the Social war

broke out, Rome was the ruling state of
Italy. She had her Roman colonies and
her Latin colonies in all parts ot‘ the Penin-
sula. The rest of Italy was filled with states
dependent on Rome: they managed their
own affairs, but they had to recruit and to
seed the armies of Rome. They were com-
prehended under the name of ‘Socii et
Latini’ (De Am. c. 3) or ⁴ Socii nomen-
que Latinum.’ The Latini formed a de-
pendent class apart from the rest: they
were nearest to Rome, and felt her power
the most. The rest were Socii or Foederati,
whose condition varied according to the
terms of their several Foedera.

The Italians claimed in return for their
services equality of civil rights. They de-
manded the Romana civitas, the Suffragium
and Honores, or access to the highest places

Quum hic domicilium Romae

in the Republic. Rome refused, and the
Italian states began the Marsic or Social war
B c. 91, 90. In Bc. 90 the Romans by a
Lex Julia gave the civitas to those who had
not revolted, to all the Latini, and part of
the Socii (Pro Balbo, c. ὃς Gellius, iv. 4).
In the following year, in the consulship of
Cn. Pompeius Strabo and L. Porcius Cato,
a Lex was enacted, which is generally
named the Lex Plautia et Papiria, the Lex
which Cicero calls the Lex of Silvanus and
Carbo. The names of the two tr. pl. who
proposed it were C. Papirius Carbo and M.
Plautius Silvanus. We do not know the
ternis of the Lex, but probably it gave the
civitas on certain conditions to all those
states which had not got it by the Lex
J ulia. The part of the Lex which Cicero
quotes only applied to Archias‘ case; and
we know nothing of the general provisions
of the Lex by which the civitas was given
to the several Italian communities.

The meaning of ‘ascripti’ is collected
from this passage, from another in the ora-
tion Pro Balbo, c. 12, and from a passage
in one of Cicero’s letters (Ad Div. xiii. 30):
“ L. Manlius est Sosis. Is fuit Catinensis:
scd est una cum reliquis Neapolitanis civis
Romanus factus decurioque Neapoli; erat
enim adscriptus in id municipium ante civi-
tatem sociis et Latinis datam.'’

domicilium] See Vol. 1. Verr. ii. e. 3,
note. Cicero afterwards gives a definition
of ‘domiciliumz' “is qui tot annis ante
civitatem datam sedem omnium rerum ac
fortunarum suarum Romae collocavit.’'
This old definitior] was in substance the
(letinition of the later jurists (Ulpian, Dig.
50. l. 27. ξ 1): “si quis negotia sua non
in colonia, sed in municipio semper agit, in
illo vendit, emit, contrahit, in eo foro,
balineo, spectaculis utitur, ibi festos dies
celebrat, omnibus denique municipii com—
modis utitur, nullis coloniarum fruitur, ibi
magis habere domicilium quani ubi colendi
ruris causa versatur videtur.''—‘ Q. Metel-
lumz’ this is Pius, Praetor in B.c. 89, the
son of Numidicus.
