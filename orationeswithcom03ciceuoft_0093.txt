OAP. 5, 6.- 79

videntur misera atque miseranda, idcirco in eos qui ea perficere
voluerunt me severum vehementemque praebeo. Etenim quaero,
si quis paterfamilias, liberis suis a servo interfectis, uxore occisa,
incensa domo, supplicium de servis non quam acerbissimum sump-
serit, utrum is clemens ac misericors an inhumanissimus et crude-
lissimus esse videatur? Mihi vero,importunus ac ferreus qui non
dolore ac cruciatu nocentis suum dolorem cruciatumque lenierit.
Sic nos in his hominibus, qui nos, qui conjuges, qui liberos nostros
trucidare voluerunt, ¹qui singulas unius cujusque nostrum domos et
hoc universum rei publicae domicilium delere conati sunt, qui id
egerunt ut gentem Allobrogum in vestigiis hujus urbis atque in
cinere deflagrati imperii collocarent, si vehementissimi fuerimus,
misericordes habebimur3 sin remissiores esse voluerimus, summae
nobis crudelitatis in patriae civiumque pernicie fama subeunda est.
Nisi vero cuipiam L. Caesar, vir fortissimus et amantissimus rei
publicae, >crudelior nudiustertius visus est, quum sororis suae, femi-
nae lectissimae, virum, praesentem et audientem, vita privandum
esse dixit, quum avum suum jussu consulis interfectum filiumque

si quis] Such things happened some-
times. A master fell by the hand of his
slave, or in his absence the house was burnt
to the ground and the man’s family massa-
cred. The man’s feeling of his wrong, his
lore to his family, is measured by the ven-
geance which he takes for the crime. By
punishing without mercy he sustains the
character of a mild and merciful man, and
soothes his anguish by the pain inflicted on
those who have robbed him of all. If one
slave killed his master or committed the
crime which Cicero mentions, all the slaves
in the house were liable to be tortured and
punished. “ In such a case,” says Tacitus
(Ann. xiv. 42), “it was an old custom for
all the slaves who had been under the same
roof to be led to punishment.'⁷ This cus-
tom was confirmed by a Senatus consultum
under Augustus, and there was another to
the same effect in Nero’s time, ΑΛ). 57:
‘· Factum et Senatus consultum ultioni juxta
et securitati: Ut si quis a suis servis inter-
fectus esset, ii quoque qui testamento manu-
missi sub eodem tecto mansissent inter
servos supplicia penderent '⁷ (Tacit. Ann.
xiii. 32). When Marcellus was assassinated
before his tent at Athens, the slaves except
a few ran away through fear (Cicero, Ad Fam.
iv. 12). —‘ de servis :’ ‘ de servo,’ Halm.

L. Caes-am] He was consul 13.c. 64.
His sister Julia married M. Antonius Creti-
cus, one of the two sous of M. Antonius the

orator3 and she had by him three sonS‚ one
of whom was M. Antonius, afterwards one
of the Triumvirate with C. Octavius and
Lepidus. After the death of Creticus, Julia
married the conspirator P. Lentulus Sura.
See Cicero, Phil. ii. c. 6.

avum suum] L. Caesar was the son of
L. Julius Caesar, consul B.c. 90, and of
Fulvia, the daughter of M. Fulvius Flaccus,
consul ac. 1⁴25, and the conqueror of the
Ligurian Salyes. Flaccus was leagued with
C. Gracchus, and he and his two sons lost
their lives at the same time as Gracchus.
Cicero speaks here of a son who was sent
by his father on a mission, was imprisoned
and put to death. It is hard to understand
why L. Caesar should speak of this crue]
execution of the youth. He is not repre-
sented as saying that he was justly put to
death 3 but as he speaks of the death of the
father, which he certainly did not disapprove,
for he proposed that Lentulus should bc
treated the same way, and as he mentions
the son and the father together, and just in
the same terum, the true conclusion is that
he meant to say that they both deserved
the same fate. Plutarch's story is, though
it is not very clearly told, that the father
and the elder son perished together, aud wc
may infer that both of them had taken up
arms (Plutarch, C. Gracchus, c. 115). Again
Plutarch says (c. 17) of the encmies of
Gracchus: “But their conduct was most
