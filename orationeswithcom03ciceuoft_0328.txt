314 ORAT. QUUM SENATUI GRATIAS EGIT

publice promulgarit de mea salute cum collegis paene omnibus,
direptoribus autem bonorum meorum in jus adeundi potestatem non
fecerit. M. autem Calidius statim designatus sententia sua quam
esset cara sibi mea salus declaravit. Omnia officia G. Septimii, Q.
Valerii, P. Crassi, Sex. Quintilii, O. Cornuti summa et in me etin
rem publicam constiterunt.

Quae quum libenter commemoro, tum non invitus nonnullorum
in me nefarie commissa praetereo. Non est mei temporis injurias
meminisse, quas ego etiamsi ulcisci possem, tamen oblivisci mallem.
Alio transferenda mea tota vita est, ut bene de me meritis referam
gratiam, amicitias igni perspectas tuear, cum apertis hostibus

use of metaphor lai-geht, use it better than
we do; at least the best French writers do.

The words ‘in jus adeuudi’ mean that
the praetor Caecilius would not allow the
plunderers of Cicero's property to enter his
eourt3 he refused to allow them the same
actions as he allowed to other people. It
was the functiou of the praetor ‘judicium
dare.y Hotmann conjectures that there
was some dispute about Cicero’s property;
but the writer does not say so, nor is there
any reason for the conjecture, except the
difficulty which suggested this to Hotmann,
that the praetor could not have refused
then] justice, if they applied to him about
other matters. The plunderers of course
could not have brought their own misdceds
before the praetor, or have asked him to
give them power to take possession of
Cicero's property (Wolf). They had taken
possession as we are told, and that was
enough for them. It must have been about
other matters then that the praetor refused
them access to liis court, and Hotmann
properly asks “de aliis rebus quo jure. deue-
gasset?'' Nobody can tell. The praetor’s
edict contains a list of persons who were
not allowed to postulate in his court (Dig.
3. tit. l, De l'ostulando). ‘⁴ Nam quosdam
(Praetor),'' says Ulpian, “in totum pro-
hibuit postulare‚ quibusdam pro se permisit,
quibusdam et pro certis duntaxat personis
et pro se permisit.” All the incapacities
which are enumerated in the edict are gene-
ral, and belong to classes of persons well
defined. Even the Infames could postulate
for themselves and for certain other persons
nearly related to them, but not for all per-
sons. How then could the praetor refuse
justice to the plunderers of Cicero's pro-
perty? Both the fact and the expression show
that this passage is not from Cicero's haud.
⁴ Iu jus ' is the praetor's court. The expres-

sion ‘ in jus adeundi potestatem ’ is unusual ;
but there is (Verr. ii. 2. c. ⁶23> “ autequam
in jus aditum esset.” The usual expression
is ‘ injus ire‚’ or ‘praetorem adire( or ‘ad
praetorem ’ (Pro Flacco, c. 21).

Omnia officia] ‘⁴ All these praetors had
been on Cicero's side, but they had seve-
rally done less for him, and accordingly he
thauks them only in general'’ (Klotz).
Just 50.

mei temporis] So Cicero uses ‘mei in-
genii ' in the genitive, which may be com-
pared with this as to the form. He means
licre, I suppose, it is not suitable to my
present circumstances to remember my
wrongs3 and yet he has said enough about
them.

‘ Si ulcisci possem . . . mallem! He says.
“If Ι could have avenged them, I would
have preferred to forget them.'' He would
have spoken more to the purpose if he had
said, ‘⁶ If I could revenge my wrongs, I
would not.'' Wolf has the following re-
mark on these words: “Animus in his
melior apparet quam Latina oratio. Ista
enim imperfectorum consequutio hoc sig-
nificat, iujurias fortasse eum oblivisci non
malle, si ulciscendi facultatem haberet:
unde efficitur ridiculum illud, quod vulgo
per jocum dicunt: ‘ Primum quidem non
possum, tum et voluutas cessat! At nonne
ita saepe scribit optimus quisque: ‘ Etiamsi
possem, non facerem ?’ Quidni scribant,
ubicumque vis sententiae et ratio fert? hic
autem, ubi non invitus ad lenitatem rediit,
sententiam ista ratione ineptam fieri, facile
quisque sentit. Multo aliter Cicero Catil.
ii. 8 : ‘Quos ego, si ullo modo fieri possit,
non tam ulcisci studeo, quam sanare et
ipsos placare rei publicae.' ‘’
