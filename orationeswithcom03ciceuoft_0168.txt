Sullam, quis Publium, quis M. Laecam, quis C. Cornelium defendendum
putavit?”), that the Publius Sulla mentioned by Sallustius was the
brother of Servius Sulla, both of them sons of Servius Sulla, the Dic-
tator’s brother3 and that consequently Cicero's client P. Cornelius
Sulla was not the P. Sulla mentioned by Sallustius. Drumann (Gre-
schichte Roms, Cornelii Sullae), who has examined the matter very
superficially, assumes Cicero's client to be the son of Servius the brother
of the Dictator Sulla.

This P. Cornelius Sulla was one of those who enriched themselves
during the Dictator's proscription (13.6. 82) by buying the property of
those who were on the bloody lists. In Bc. 66 116 was elected consul
sor Β.6. 65 with P. Autronius Paetus, but both of the consules desig-
nati were prosecuted under the Lex Calpurnia de Ambitu by L.
lNIanlius Torquatus, the son of Torquatus, a rival candidate3 and both
of the consules designati were convicted. L. Aurelius Cotta and L.
EIanlius Torquatus were elected consuls in the place of Sulla and
Autronius. (Introduction to the Orations against Catilina.)

Autronius attempted to disturb by violence the proceedings when he
was tried for bribery (c. 5), while Sulla quietly submitted to be con-
demned. After his conviction Autronius joined Catilina in his desperate
designs, and was an accomplice in what is called the first conspiracy of
Catilina (Sallust, Cat. c. 183 Introd. to the Orations against Catilina).
Sallust does not mention Sulla as implicated in the first conspiracy,
though the guilt of Sulla is asserted by other authorities (Dion Cassius,
36, 6. 273 Suetonius, Caesar, 6. 93 Livy, Epit. 101). Sallust’s silence
about Sulla is not decisive evidence that he was innocent, but it is
strange if he was guilty that he should not mention him as 0116 of the
conspirators with Catilina and Autronius, when in the same chapter he
tells us that Sulla and Autronius were convicted of bribery at their
electi0n3 and 116 also speaks of Autronius and Catilina as conspirators.
Cicero denies the guilt of Sulla, but he says little of this charge against
him, for Hortensius had undertaken to defend Sulla on that matter.
Cicero had written to Cn. Pompeius, who was then 111 Asia, a long
letter about what he had done in his consulship, and Torquatus at-
tempted to get some evidence out of this letter that Cicero believed
Sulla to have been privy to the first conspiracy (Pro Sulla, c. 24). But
no conclusion either one way or the other can be got out of this passage
111 Cicero's speech, except that he intends to deny Sulla’s guilt.

After this time Sulla lived in retirement at Naples, as Cicero tells us.
At the close of 11061 the tribune L. Caecilius, Sulla’s half-brother,
proposed a Lex, which had for its object among other things, to restore
to Autronius and Sulla their Senatorial rank and their capacity to hold
office (Dion Cassius, 37. c. 25). Halm concludes that Sulla was at
