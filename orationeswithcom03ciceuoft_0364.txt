350 INTRODUOTION.

Though I â€˜uhink that this oration is a miserable piece of composibion,
a student who is well acquainted with Cicero may find it worth reading.
His critical faculty may be awakened or sharpened by comparing it with
the genuine orations, and by weighing the objections made against it
and the answers to the objections. I have said a great deal against it,
but not all that can be said.
