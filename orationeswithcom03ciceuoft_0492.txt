ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

esset, reliquis honoribus non tam uti voluit quam dignus videri.
Eo auctore duxit honestissimi et spectatissimi viri G. Albini filiam,

ex qua hic est puer et nupta jam filia.

Duobus his gravissimae

antiquitatis viris sic probatus fuit, ut utrique eorum et carus maxime

et jucundus esset.

Ademit Albino soceri nomen mors filiae, sed

caritatem illius necessitudinis et benevolentiam non ademit.
Hodie sic hunc diligit, ut vos facillime potestis ex hac vel assidui-

tate ejus vel sollicitudine et molestia judicare.

Duxit uxorem

patre vivo optimi et calamitosissimi viri filiam L. Scipionis. Clara
in hoc P. Sestii pietas exstitit et omnibus grata, quod et Mas-

tiorum ter praetor primus centuriis cunctis
renuntiatus sum ’' (De Imp. Cn. Pomp. c. 1.
Vol. ΙΙ.). Compare In Pison. c. 1 ; In
Vatin. c. 5.

Ιιὶσ est puer] ‘⁶ Video hunc praetextatum

ejus filium‚'’ c. 69. He was a youth who
had not taken the ⁸ toga virilis! The dress
of a youth who wore the ‘ praetexta ' or the
⁴ toga ' with a purple border distinguished
him from a man who wore the ‘toga virilis ’
which had not such a border. In a pas-
sage of Livy, referred to by Halm (22. c.
57), the ¹ praetextati ’ are spoken of as being
under seventeen : ‘⁴ delectu edicto juniores
ab annis septendecim et quosdam praetex-
tatos scribunt.” Gellius (x. 28) z ‘⁴ C. Tu-
bero in historiarum primo scripsit Servium
Tullium . . . pueros esse existimasse, qni
minores essent annis xv11 atque inde ab
anno xv11 . . . milites scripsisse.'’ The
age of ⁴ pubertas,’ on which depended the
assumption of the ⁴ toga virilis,’ was not ab·
solutely fixed: “nostri praeceptores pube-
rem etiam eum esse putant qui habitu
corporis pubertatem ostendit. hoc est, qui
generare potest—sed diversae scholae auc-
tores annis putant pubertatem aestimandam,
id est, eum puberem esse existimant qui
XIIII annos explevit‘’ (Gaius, i. 196).
The general rule appears to have been,
that when a youth had attained the age of
fourteen, he put on the ‘toga virilis,' on
the festival of the Liberalia (l7th March),
which followed next after he had attained
his fourteenth year (Ovid, Fasti. iii. 771-
788). But there are many examples of the
‘toga virilis' being assumed at different
ages, and many of them after the age of
fifteen. (Savigny, System, &m iii. ξ 109.)-
‘gravissimae antiquitatis virisz' men who
were examples ofthe good old times. Comp.
c. 62: ⁴⁴ illam divinam gravitatem plenam
antiquitatis.”

Albino soceri nomen] Affinitas was dis-
solved by the death of the wife, as we see
in the oration Pro Cluentio, ce. 12, 67 3 and

in the De Oratore i. 7: “venisse eodem,
socer ejus qui fuerat, Q. Mucius dicebatur.’'
In the Pro Quintio (c. 6, note) Cicero seems
to make ‘ affinitas ’ exist after the death of
the wife, because there were children of the
marriage: ⁴⁴ Quamobrem Hotomannus ad
h. 1. statuit propterea Albinum desiisse
socerum esse, quod Sestius novas nuptias
inierit3 Klotz autem confidenter, ut solet,
edixit liberis vivis nomen quidem soceri iu-
tercidisse, sed affinitatem ipsam mansisse '’
(Halm). ⁴ Ut solet' is well said. The
edicta of Klotz are like the famous edictum
of Scheller (Quum Senatui, c. 8).

P. Sestius and C. Albinus are mentioned
by Cicero (Ad Fam. xiii. 8).

Dzmt uxorem] ⁴ Alteram duxit uxorem,'
Schiitz: ‘Duxit iterum uxorem,' Momm-
sen. Something seems wanting. By¹patre
viv0‚’ says Graevius, he means to say that
Sestius married a second time also in his
father's lifetime, and with his father’s con-
sent. Klotz says that Cicero says ‘patre
vivo ' purposely, because the father had no
longer the same influence on the choice of
his son; and on the other hand he says
above ‘auctore e0.' There is nothing in
this. Cicero remarks that his father was
still alive; and that is all.—‘ L. Scipionis:'
consul B.c. 83, a partizan of Marius.
He was deserted by his army, which went
over to Sulla. He afterwards retired to
Massilia or to the Stoechades, as the Scho-
liast says, the five small islands off the
south coast of France east of Marseille, and
nearly opposite to Toulon. The three
lai-ger of them seem to be the Isles d’Hieres,
which were in the possession of the Massi-
liots, as well as the two smallerislands which
are near the isles d’HiereS. The story of
L. Scipio is in Plutarch, Sulla, c. 283 and
in Appian, B. C. i. 80—86.

in hoc] Madvig remarks that ‘hoc' is
not in the ablative neuter, but the masculine ε
“pietas quam Sestius in Scipionis persona
exhibuit.''
