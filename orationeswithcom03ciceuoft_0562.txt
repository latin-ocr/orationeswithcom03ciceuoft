548 ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

LII. Ecquae seditio umquam fuit in qua non ille princeps Ξ ecqui
seditiosus cui ille non familiaris? ecquae turbulenta contio cujus
ille non concitator? cui bene dixit umquam bono? bene dixit?
immo, quem fortem et bonum civem non petulantissime est insec-
tatus? qui, ut credO, non libidinis caussa, sed ut plebicola vide-
retur, libertinam duxit uxorem. Is de me suffragium tulit, is
adfuit, is interfuit epulis et gratulationibus parricidarum. In quo
tamen est me ultus, quum illo ore inimicos est meos saviatus;
qui, quasi mea culpa bona perdiderit, ita ob eam ipsam caussam est

mihi inimicus, quia nihil habet.

word in its place. In (2) he has ‘spe'
Orelli has ‘cogitatione,' which is from Her-
vagius. He was always hoping for change ;
while the state was quiet and tranquil, he
was wasting away.

52. mm libidinis cansam] Irony, says Ma-
nutius, for he plainly means to say that he
married a freedwoman
The irony does not seem very sharp. He
had a passion for the woman, Ι suppose,
and she happened not to belong to the
class of Cicero’s new friends, the ‘ nobiles.'
Again‚ he tries to make him odious by the
name Plebicola, a parody on his name
Poplicola.

Halm remarks that it appears from this
passage that even now it was 3 disgrace for
a man (an ‘ingenuus ' of course) to marry
a ‘ libertinas It hardly appears from this.
Cicero wishes to make it appear so. Halm's
authority is Becker, who says that there
was 110 ’0011111111111111,’ 11131 is, no Roman
marriage, between ‘ingenui’ and ‘liber-
tini 3' in proof of which he quotes Livy 39.
c. 19: “utique Fecenniae . .. ingenuo
nubere liceret, neu quid ei qui eam dux-
isset ob id fraudi ignominiaeve esset?
which only proves that no ‘infamia’ was the
consequence of such a marriage. He also
cites this passage, and one from Phil. ii. 2.
But Becker is mistaken. The marriage
was a marriage. Becker cites Dion Cassius
(54. c. 16; 56. 0. 7) to show that Augus-
tus permitted such marriages, except to
senators. Halm, after saying that it was
disgraceful (dedecori), a word that has no
political meaning, for‘a man to marry a
‘libertina,’ adds, “afterwards it was per-
mitted (licebat) by the Lex Papia Pop-
paea ;” which implies that before this Lex
⁴ non licebat! All this is confused.

The Lex Julia Papia Poppaea (Ulpian
xiii. ξ 1, 2) probibited the marriage of a

senator and a senator's children with a
‘libertina,’ but not the marriage of other
‘ ingenui ’ with ⁶ libertinae? But after the
enactment of the Lex Papia Poppaea the
marriage even of a senator with a ‘liber-
tina ’ was a valid marriage : it only deprived
the husband and wife of the advantages
which this Lex gave to married people:
“ aliqnando nihil inter se capiunt. id est si
contra legem J uliam Papiamque Poppaeam
contraxerint matrimonium: verbi gratia, si
famosam quis uxorem duxerit aut liberti-
nam senator'' (Ulpian xvi. ξ 2). This
means that neither husband nor wife could
take any thing by the testament of one
another, nor by the testament of a third
person. It was not till the time of M.
Aurelius that 3 SCtum declared a marriage
between a senator or a senator's children
and ¹ libertini ⁹ to be null (Dig. 23. 2. 16).
‘⁶ Both before aud after the Lex Papia the
marriage of ‘ingenui' evcn with women
who were ‘infames’ (and ι111101111130,γ as
such, were not ‘infames,’) were not null,
but merely did not confer the advantages
which were attached by the Lex to married
life, advantages which related to the capa-
city to acquire more or less by the last will
of a deceased person'' (Savigny, System,
&c, vol. ii. Beylage vii.).

ultus‚] ‘ullus’ P. G. “Antea multus
pro me ultus, reo pro ore legebatur. De-
betur loci laus praeclare restituti Octavio
Pantagatho’' (Halm).—‘saviatus,’ P. G.;
‘suaviatus‚' the common reading. Halm
has here copied a dirty note from Manu-
tius, and made a dirty addition to it. Nei-
ther one nor the other seems 10 me neces-
sary for the explanation of the text.
