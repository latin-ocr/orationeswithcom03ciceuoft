nos judices consedistis, ab accusatoribus delecti ad spem acerbitatis⁷
a fortuna nobis ad praesidium innocentiae constituti. Ut ego, quid
de me populus Romanus existimaret, quia severus in improbos
fueram, laboravi, et quae prima innocentis mihi defensio est oblata
suscepi, sic vos severitatem judiciorum, quae per hos menses in
homines audacissimos facta sunt, lenitate ac misericordia mitigate.
Hoc quum impetrare a vobis ipsa caussa debet⁷ tum est vestri animi
atque virtutis declarare, non esse eos vos ad quos potissimum inter-
posita rejectione devenire convenerit. In quo ego vos, judices,
quantum meus in vos amor postulat, tantum hortor, ut communi
studio, quoniam in re publica conjuncti sumus, mansuetudine et mise-

ricordia vestra falsam a nobis crudelitatis famam repellamus.

the prosecutor chose, and of whom the ac-
cused could only reject 3 certain number,
as for instance, after the Lex Licinia de
sodalitiis. But this Lex Licinia was not
yet enacted. Mommsen further, in a pri-
vate communication to Halm, remarks that
the accused was required to make his chal-
lcnge as soon as the names of the judices
were given to him, and that the remainder
immediately took their seats, and the trial
began: he had no time allowed for consi-
deration. A reference is made to an article
by Mommsen in the Zeitschrift fiir Ge-
schichtl. Rechtsw. (xv. p. 324); but that
passage does not prove the assertion.

We may collect as much from Cicero as
we are able to know; and yet we must re-
member that he colours facts 111 such a way
that we cannot get the truth from him.
He says: “You, after the challenge was
settled, before we could suspect any thing,
took your seats all at once as our judices,
selected by the prosecutors because they
hoped that you would bc inexorable, but
appointed by our good luck to protect in-
nocence.'' Nobody can tell what all this
means, unless he can tell us the exact facts;
and nobody can do that. The expression
‘rejectionem interponere' seems to mean
no more than that the challenge must come
before the trial begins: it is an act inter-
posed. Cicero says that it was done quick.
before the defendants had time to look

about them. The judices were selected by
the prosecutors because they expected that
these judices would condemn3 but though
chosen by the prosecutors with this view,
the goddess Fortune made them the pro-
tectors of innocence. Mai publishcd a Scho-
liast on this oration, supposed to be Asco-
nianus Pedianus.’ The Scholiast observes
that the meaning is very obscure, and he
proceeds to explain it. But he has done
nothing.

l have translated ‘in nos judices’ by
‘ our judices,' which is right. It does not
mean ¹ against us,' for that would contradict
what follows. Compare Pro Cluentio, c.
10: “in quem judices non estis” (Vol. IL).

The Delecti judices are the judices taken
for a particular case. The Selecti judices
are those whose names were in the Album
Judicum (Index, Vol. Ι.).

per hos menses] See the Introduction.
The whole context, ‘prima innocentis de-
fensio’ and ‘per hos 1nenses‚' leads to the
conclusion that this trial took place in B.c.
62.—‘ non esse eos vosz' “that you are
not the men to whose decision before all
others the prosecutors should have brought
their case.'’ This is the meaning. It may
be expressed in various ways.
