174⁴ ORAT. PRO P. SULLA

heridis, quae domesticos hostes, ne ab iis ipsa¹ necaretur, necavit?
Itaque attende, Torquate, quam ego defugiam auctoritatem con-
sulatus mei. Maxima voce ut omnes exaudire possint dico,
semperque dicam: adeste omnes animis qui adestis, quorum ego
frequentia magno opere laetor; erigite mentes auresque vestras, et
me de invidiosis rebus, ut ille putat, dicentem attendite—Ego
consul, quum exercitus perditorum civium clandestino scelere con-
flatus crudelissimum et luctuosissimum exitium patriae comparasset,
quum ad occasum interitumque rei publicae Catilina in castris, in
his autem templis et tectis dux Lentulus esset constitutus, meis
consiliis, meis laboribus, mei capitis periculis, sine tumultu, sine
delectu, sine armis, sine exercitu, quinque hominibus comprehensis
atque confessis, incensione urbem, internicione cives, vastitate
Italiam, interitu rem publicam liberavi; ego vitam omnium civium,
statum orbis terrae, urbem hanc denique, sedem onmium nostrum,
arcem regum ac nationum exterarum, lumen gentium, domicilium
imperii quinque hominum amentium ac perditorum poena redemi.—
An me existimasti haec injuratum in judicio non esse dicturum,

dffuyiam] ‘Defugere’ means ‘to run
away from‚' ‘to shrink from) Cicero says:
‘⁴ Now then mark, Torquatus, how I shrink
from maintaining what. I did in my consul-

sit.” But if we had no history except
Cicero’s, we should often make false con-
clusions.

quinque hominibus] See In Cat. iii. 6,

ship.” Lambinus says it is the French note.
‘desavouem’our¹disavow.⁷ Some old edi· confessis] Orelli has the monstrous

reading ¹ confossis‚' with the remark ‘ Cdd.
aliq! Ι do not see the difficulty about·
‘ confessis.y They did confess in a manner
(In Cat. iii. e. 5). They were convicted by
evidence, and they were put to death. lf
Cicero simply says, ‘by the seizure and

110115 have ‘ non defugiam‚' which means the
same, for if the negative is omitted, Cicero
is speaking ironically.

qui adestis] The reading of T. V. B. S.;
‘ adestis corpore,’ cod. Pithoei3 ‘ adestis cor-
poribu5,’ 501116 inferior MSS. The MSS.

authority is against ‘ corporibus,’ but Ι am
inclined to think that 11 may be Cicero's
genuine text.

sine lvmullu,] This means ‘tumultu non
decreto’ (Sylvius). There was no procla-
mation made though there was reason for
it. Cicero says (Phil. v. 12), “Tumultum
decerni. justitium edici, saga sumi dico
oportere.'’ A Gallie or an Italic war was a
⁴ tumultus ’ (Cicero, Phil. viii. 1). “Quum
igitur bellum hujusmodi impendebat, tu-
multum esse decernebat SenatuS, ut vaca-
tiones tollerentur.'' Comp. In Cat.. i. 6. 5,
“ 1111110 tumultu publice concitato.'’ Cicero
seems to mean that there was no arming in
the city (sine delectu), for every body
knew that the Republic sent an army
against Catilina. Sallust (c. 313): “'prae-
terea decernit (senatus) ut consules delec-
tum habeant, Antonius eum exercitu Cati-
linum persequi maturet, Cicero urbi praesidio

confession of five Ι rescued the State from
ruin,' that was enough. Every body knew
that they were strangled. But a few lines
further he says ‘quinque hominum . . .
poena.' There is good MSS. authority for
‘confessis‚' T. V. B. The men were not
⁴ confossi ι’ they were strangled. The con-
fession is spoken of by Cicero (In Cat. iii.
c. 63 iv. c. 3). Halm thinks that ‘con-
fessis’ is the same as ‘ad confessionem
adactis ς’ I think not.

lumen yentium‚] He says (In Cat. iv.
6. 6) ‘lucem orbis terrarum‚’ on which
Halm has the following note.- ‘⁶ Rome 15
called Lux orbis terrarum as the lamp of
the earth, because it was the ruling city
from which as from the sun all light pro-
ceeded3 on the other hand it is called
Lumen gentium (Pro Sulla, c. 11) as
the illuminated point, compared with which
all other Gentes were in the shade.'' ‘Lux'
