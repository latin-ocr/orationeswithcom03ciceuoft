GAP. 13, 14. 495

colonia, nulla praefectura, nulla Romae societas vectigalium, nullum
collegium aut concilium aut omnino aliquod commune consilium,
quod tum non honorificentissime de mea salute decrevisset, quum
subito edicunt duo consules, ut ad suum vestitum senatores re-
dirent, Quis umquam consul senatum ipsius decretis parere prohi-
buit? quis tyrannus miseros lugere vetuit? Parumne est, Piso,
ut omittam Gabinium, quod tantum homines fefellisti, ut negli-
geres auctoritatem senatus, optimi cujusque consilia contemneres,
rem publicam proderes, consulare nomen affligeres? etiamne edicere
audeas, ne maererent homines meam, suam, rei publicae calami-
tatem, ne hunc suum dolorem veste significarent? Sive illa vestis
mutatio ad luctum ipsorum sive ad deprecandum valebat, quis um-
quam tam crudelis fuit qui prohiberet quemquam aut sibi maerere
aut ceteris supplicare? Quid, sua sponte homines in amicorum
periculis vestitum mutare non solent? pro te ipso, Piso, nemone

 

14. societas vectigalium] “Though these
‘societates ’ had a ‘corpus,' yet they are
always distinguished from ⁴ collegia.' v.
Mommsen de Coll. p. 84 seq.” (Halm).
To have a ‘corpus’ means to have the
quality of an artificial person (Verr. ii. 2.
c. 70, note). These ‘societates' for pur-
poses of commerce were not called ‘collegia,'
but ‘societates' or ‘privatae societates.’
The name of ⁴ collegia’ which were esta-
blished for other pumoses, something like
our clubs, was ‘sodalitates‚’ ‘ sodalitia,' ‘col-
legia sodalitia.' There is a title in the Di-
gest, De Collegiis et Corporibus (47. 22),
where Caius says (47. 22. 4): “Sodales
sunt qui ejusdem collegii sunt, quam Graeci
ἑταιρίαν vocant.''

concilium] Is a body of men called to-
gether for any purpose. A ‘commune con--
silium ’ sometimes means a senate or a body
like a senate. If Cicero uttered both ‘con-
cilium ' and ‘ consilium,' and these are two
different words, as we suppose, we may

’ἐ · assume that the sound was different, and

that ‘ ci’ is the same as ‘ ki?

audeaa] Lambinus proposed to write
‘audebas‚' which Madvig approves. He ob-
jects to ‘audeas’ that the orator is speaking
of what Piso did in his consulship: ‘pa-
rumne est, quod . . . fefellisti ;y and that
¹ audeas‚’ if it is right, must be taken ὐπο-
Θετικῶς, and yet this is disproved by the
imperfects which follow—But the objection
on account of ⁴ maererent’ seems to have
no weight. Halm correctly observes that if
Cicero intended to use the past tense he
would have said ‘ausus es,’ as In Pison.
c. 18: “ edicere est ausus . . . ut senatus

contra quam ipse censuisset ad vestitum
rediret.’' I think that ‘audeas' is right.
He says ‘⁴ Is it a small matter,'' where he
uses the present; and he further says,
‘⁴ should you even be bold enough to make
an ⁶ edictum,’ ’' διο.

ceteris supplicare .7] The opposition of
‘sibi ’ and ‘ceteris ' shows that Hotmann
understood this right: ⁴¹ to forbid any per-
son to lament his own misfortunes (sibi),
or to be a suppliant for others (ceteris) in
their misfortunes.” Halm compares Verr.
ii. 2. c. 8: ‘⁴ Hunc hominem Veneri ab-
solvit, sibi condemnat.''

pro te ipso, Piso‚] Piso was in Mace-
donia, where he was proconsul (c. 43).
Ρ. G. have ‘ mutavit! Halm cites ‘Lal-
lemand' as the authority for ‘ mutabit ς’
and Wolf (Quum Populo, c. 5, note) says:
‘⁴ id vocabulum mutarit . . . corruptum est
et corrigendum mutabit, ut sequentia at-
tente legenti luce clarius apparebit.” Here
he addresses Piso, though he was not pre-
sent3 and the Declamator does so in the
Quum Senatui (c. 7, note), to which I
direct the reader’s attention that he may,
if he chooses, use this passage as an argu-
ment in defence of the other-3 for truth
should always be told, and there is no duty
more agreeable to him who seeks the truth
than to furnish his opponents with the best
arguments that he can. When the ‘ can-
didus lector’ has read both passages and
compared the ways in which the thing is
treated in both, I believe, if his judgment
is sound, that the case of the Declamator
will gain nothing by the help of this pas-
sage.
