OAP. 7, 8. 63
omnia, Quirites, ita sunt a me administrata ut deorum immortalium
nutu atque consilio et gesta et provisa esse videantur: idque quum
conjectura consequi possumus, quod vix videtur humani consilii
tantarum rerum gubernatio esse potuisse; tum vero ita praesentes
his temporibus opem et auxilium nobis tulerunt ut eos paene oeulis
videre possemus. Nam ut illa omittam, visas nocturno ternpore
ab occidente faces ardoremque caeli, ut fulminum jactus, ut terrae
motus relinquam, ut omittam cetera quae tam multa nobis con-
sulibus facta sunt, ut haec quae nune fiunt canere dii immortales
viderentur, hoc certe, Quirites, quod sum dicturus neque praeter-
mittendum neque relinquendum est. Nam profecto memoria
tenetis, Cotta et Torquato consulibus complures in Capitolio res de
caelo esse percussaS‚ quum et simulacra deorum immortalium
depulsa sunt, et statuae veterum hominum dejectae, et legum aera
liquefacta3 taetus est etiam ille qui hanc urbem condidit Romulus,
quem inauratum in Capitolio parvum atque lactentem uberibus

mihi quidem,” διε. The division into chap-
ters is one of the great faults of our editions,
though the division is convenient for some
purposes ; but here we have besides the

from the second book of his poem on his
consulship.

praeterminondum—relinquendum] Halm
explains the difference between these two
words by a passage in the De Officiis (iii.
e. 2): ‘¹ Minime vero assentior iis qui ne-
gant eum locum a Panaetio praetermissum,
sed consulto relictum.''

division into chapters the commencement of
a new paragraph in the editions. This
‘ Quamquam haec omnia' is the continua-
tion of what has just been said. He adds,

“ Howsoever (‘quamquam,' ‘in some way
or other,’ ‘ however that may be’), Ι have
managed all this in such a way that every
thing seems to have been done and provided
with the consent and by the wisdom of the
immortal gods.''

Cicero often speaks in this style in his
orations. He wished to work on the super-
stition of his hearers ; though if, as he says
in another place (Pro Cluentio, c. 61. Vol.
IL), the stories about punishment after
death were considered to be an idle tale,
the belief in signs and wonders may have
been weakened also. But there is still a
great difference between unbelief about the
unseen, and the effect produced hythe sight
of wonderful and unusual appearances. A
man may be terrified by the comet, or the
tempest, or the earthquake‚ and consider
them the effect of supernatural agency, who
may laugh at the story of Cerberus and
Ixion.

ut illa omit!am‚] Cicero even put this
into poeti-y, such as he wrote. There is a
long passage in the Divin. i. c. ll, which
begins :

“Principio aetherio flammatus Juppiter
igni,

Cotta et Torquato] In B.c. 65. Dion
Cassius (37. e. 9) speaks of- the writing on
the tablets being melted and made iudis-
tinet. Tacitus (Hist. iv. 40) has the ex-
pression ‘ legum aera,' the bronzes on which
the Leges were written. Some fragments
of such bronzes are still extant. Ovid
alludes to the practice of fixing these bronze

tablets to walls or other fiat surfaces by
metal pins:

 

nec verba minacia fixo
Aere legebantur.'' (Met. i. 91.)

The figure of the wolf suckling the chil-
dren was also damaged as we are told herey
and again in a passage in the De Divina-
tione (ii. 20) :—

⁴‘Nam pater altitonans stellanti nixus
Olympo
Ipse suos quondam tumulos ac templa
Etpgiipiiolinis injecit sedibus ignes.

Tum statua Nattae, tum simulacra deorum,
Romulusque et. Remus cum altrice belua,
vi fulminis icti conciderunt, deque his rebus
haruspicum exstiterunt responsa verissima.'’
