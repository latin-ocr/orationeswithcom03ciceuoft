380 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA
scriptio tibi num aliud videtur esse ac meorum bonorum direptio?
praeterquam quod ne id quidem per legem Liciniam, ut ipse tibi
curationem ferres facere potuisti? Quid hoc ipsum, quod nunc
apud pontifices agis, te meam domum consecrasse, te monumentum
fecisse in meis aedibus, te signum dedicasse, eaque te ex una roga-
tiuncula fecisse, unum et idem videtur esse atque id quod de me ipso
nominatim tulisti ’Ξ Tam hercule est unum, quam quod idem tu
lege una tulisti, ut Cyprius reX, cujus majores huic populo socii
atque amici semper fuerunt, cum bonis omnibns sub praecone
subjiceretur et exsules Byzantium reducerentur. Eidem, inquit,
utraque de re negotium dedi. Quid, si eidem negotium dedisses,
utin Asia cistophorum flagitaret, inde iret in Hispaniam, quum

was to be erected on the site of Cicero’s
house, and to see that the contractors (reu
demptores) did their work properly. This
is Ferratius' explanation. On the words
‘ tibi nmn aliud ' Wolf remarks, ¹‘ Ridicula
interrogatio, qua postulatur ab ipso Clodio,
ut affirmet, rem sibi nihil aliud videri nisi
direptionem.''

See how he handles the matter. First he
says Clodius' Lex enacted that no man
should receive Cicero in his house, but the
Lex did not say that he must go. And for
a good reason. He was gone when the in·
terdict was enacted 3 and such an Interdic-
tum did not in formal words send a man
away : it accomplished this by depriving
him of the necessaries of life, fire, water,
and house within certain limits ; as this
writer tells us (c. 30). Again 116 returns to
his point like a man who persists in repeat-
ing his words, when there is no sense in
what he says. ⁴ Ejection is not mentioned.'
But he is so strong in his case, he can give
up that point (verum sit): perhaps he re-
collected that he had said (Quum Populo,
c. 4) that he was ejected (a quibus ejectus
sum). He then asks if Clodius' superin-
tendence of the ‘ opera publica,’ whatever
these ‘ opera publica ’ were, and the inscrip—
tion of his name, must not 116 considered a
plundering of Cicero's property. He might
as well have asked if it was not murder.

leyem Liciniam,] ‘¹ Licinia est lex et al-
tera Aebutia, quae non modo eum qui tule-
rit de aliqua curatione 36 potestate, sed
etiam collegas ejus, cognatos, affines excipit,
ne eis 63 potestas curatiove mandetur” (Vol.
II. De Lege Agrar. ii. c. 8). Here we have
the genuine expression ‘tulerit de aliqua
curatione) in place of which this writer has
the expression ⁴ ipse tibi curationem ferres,’
which, as Markland observes, is not Latin.

Cyprius reoe,] Ptolemaeus, c. 8.-The
story of these Byzantine exiles is told by
Plutarch (Cato Min. c. 34) : ‘⁴ And as if he
had given him (Cato) but small occupation
with the affairs of Cyprus and Ptolemaeus,
Clodius commissioned him also to restore
the Byzantine fugitives, his wish being that
Cato should bc as long as possible from
Rome during his tribuneship.’' Compare
Pro Sestio, c. 263 and Cicero (Ad Q. Fra-
trem, ii. 9).

sub praecone] ‘ sub praeconem,' VVesen-
berg, Baiter.—⁴ dedisses, M. :’ ⁸ dedisset, P.
G.,’ Baiter, and ‘ scriberet ’ for ‘ scriberes.’

Asia cistophorum] The ‘cistophorus'
was a silver coin of the kingdom of Perga-
mum, and was generally in circulation in
the Roman province of Asia. It had on it
the representation of a ‘cista,’ or sacred
chest, whence the name. In this passage
there is an allusion to Gabinius and perhaps
to Piso also. The writer supposes many
things put in one Lex, and asks if the Lex
could be called one, because it all related
to one man; who is supposed to have a
commission for demanding ‘ cistophorus ’ in
Asia, then for going to Spain and so on.
As this is‘merely an hypothetical case, the
writer is inexcusable for the expression ‘in
Asia cistophorum flagitaret,’ without letting
us know on what ground or for what pur-
pose, or something. We can easily fix a
meaning to the passage, but it is a writer’s
business to tell us what he means. ‘⁶ An
allusion,'’ says Klotz, “to A. Gabinius,
which, as Gesner remarks, must have been
immediately understood by every person
who was informed of the facts.’' This is of
a piece with Scheller's famous ‘edictum’
(Quum Senatui, c. 8). How must people
know a thing, says Wolf, except by means
of plain words ?
