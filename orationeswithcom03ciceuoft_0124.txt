110 ORAT. PRO L. MURENA

dignitas in tam tenui scientia non potest esse. Res enirn sunt
parvae, prope in singulis litteris atque interpunctionibus verborum
occupatae. Deinde, etiam si quid apud majores nostros fuit in isto
studio admirationis, id enuntiatis vestris mysteriis totum est con-
temptum et abjectum. Posset agi lege necne pauci quondam
sciebant3 fastos enim vulgo non habebant. Erant in magna po-
tentia qui consulebantur, a quibus etiam dies tamquam a Chaldaeis
petebantur. Inventus est scriba quidam Gn. Flavius qui cornicum
oculos confixerit, et singulis diebus ediscendis fastos populo pro-
posuerit, et ab ipsis caussis jurisconsultis eorum sapientiam compi-
larit. Itaque irati illi, quod sunt veriti ne dierum ratione pervulgata
et cognita sine sua opera lege agi posset, [verba] quaedam compo-

suerunt ut omnibus in rebus ipsi interessent.

α Chaldaeis] These astrologers were at
Rome in Cicero’s time. They cast nativi-
ties, told fortunes, and other things of that
kind. Horace alludes to these mischievous
follows (Cal-m. i. ll); and Juvenal (x.

“Principis angusta Caprearum in rupe
sedentis
Cum grege Chaldaeo.'’

And Sat. vi. 553:

“Chaldaeis sed major erit fiducia: quid-
Diitldisit astrologus, credent a fonte re-
latum
Hammonis.’'

And Gellius, xiv. l.

Cn. Flavius] The story about Flavius is
this ε He was a ‘ scriba ' or clerk to Appius
Claudius Caecus, a proud patrician. At this
time the patricians had the law in their
hands. They were alone acquainted with
the technicalities of procedure, and with the
days on which any legal act could be done.
It was not only the forms of actions
and the formalities that must be observed,
which they kept a secret, or of which they
had the exclusive knowledge: there were
many matters relating to the transacting of
business, such as sales, manumission, and
other matters, in which forms must be
strictly observcd‚ for the Romans were
most rigid formalists. Flavius either stole
or promulgatcd many forms and the rules
about the days in the Kalendar (Dig. l. 2.
2. ξ 7); οι· he got his knowledge by being
employed in legal matters, and having a
sharp eye for practice. This story about
Flavius is not very clear. Livy (ix. 46) says
that he made his publications after he was

‘ aedilis curulis ε’ “ Civile jus repositum in
penetralibus pontificum evulgavit, fastosque
circum forum in albo proposuit ut quando
lege agi posset sciretur.’' There is some-
thing more about Flavius in Gellius (vi. 9),
and Pliny (33. c. l), and Cicero (Ad Att.
vi. 1‚8; and De Or. i. 41).

cornicum oculos] This is a proverb which
means to cheat the cunning. Pro Flacco,
c. ⁶20.—⁴ caussis-eorum ι’ the MSS. read-
ing, which is unintelligible. Halm has
¹ capsis jureconsultorum,’ Madvig's emenda-
tion. For ‘caussis' some editions have
‘ cautis.’

verba quaedam] Halm writes ‘verba,'
following Niebuhr and Steinmetz. M. and
some other MSS. have ‘vero ac aedam,'
which may be a corruption of ‘ verba quae-
dam 3’ some have ⁴ vero acedam ς’ one has
⁶ vero ac eadem ς’ another ‘vere cicadam 3'
and G. has ‘accedam‚’ whence Mommsen
makes ‘lege posset agi, quaedam.’ It does
not appear that there is any MSS. autho-
rity for the usual reading ¹ n‹›tas quasdam!
Halm merely says, “notas quasdam edd.
priores et Orelli.” But if ‘ notas ’ is diffi-
cult to explain, ⁴ verba ' is not easier. Cicero
says that the “jurisconsulti being afraid
that when the rules about the days were
known, all legal acts and all legal pro-
cedure might take place without their as-
sistance, composed certain things in order
that they might have a part in all that was
done.” Klotz, following Niebuhr, says
we must understand thern to be “solen-
nia verborum carmina, verba concepta.''
The true explanation may be that Cicero
meant nothing at all 3 and that the alleged
publication of Flavius was not followed by
any new devices of the Patricians.
