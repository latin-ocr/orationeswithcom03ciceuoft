ORAT. PRO P. SESTIO

ierunt malis ominibus atque exsecrationibus duo vulturii paludati ε
quibus utinam ipsis evenissent ea quae tum homines precabantur!
neque nos provinciam Macedoniam cum exercitu neque equita-

tum in Syria et cohortes optimas perdidissemus.

Ineunt magis- ’

tratum tribuni plebis, qui omnes se de me promulgaturos confirma-

rant.

Ex iis princeps emitur ab inimicis meis is quem homines

in luctu irridentes Gracchum vocabant3 quoniam id etiam fatum
civitatis fuit, ut illa ex vepreculis extracta nitedula rem publicam

conaretur arrodere.

Alter vero, non ille Serranus ab aratro, sed

ex deserto Gavii † olaeliore a calatis Gaviis in Calatinos Atilios
insitus, subito, nominibus in tabulas relatis, nomen suum de tabula

Lambinus is absurd. If they did breathe
again, having not yet in fact, but only in
hope restored the state, what is the hope ?
Why, it is what Cicero means to say, ⁴ spes
rei publicae recuperandae ;’ and accordingly
he sa vs it.

mallis ominibus] They left Rome for
their provinces, Piso for Macedonia and
Gabinius for Syria. Halm refers to the
In Piso'nem, c. 14: ‘⁴ au quod tibi proficis-
centi evenit, ut omnes exsecrarentur, male
precarentur, unam tibi illam viam et per-
petuam esse vellent ?'’ When M. Crassus
(Plutarch, Crassus, c. 16) left Rome for his
eastern expedition, he was cursed in all due
form.

emitur . . . is] Supposed to be Q. Nu-
merius Rufus, one of the tribuni pl. who
obstinately opposed Cicero’s recall (Schol.).
Nobody can tell why so worthless a fellow
was named Gracchus. Halm suggests that
the man¹s voice was small. and reminded
people of a ‘graculus,' and so they called
him Gracchus. He calls him ‘nitedula‚' a
little mouse or weasel. Servius (virg. Georg.
i. 181) has: “nitela, mus agrestis rubeus,
cujus meminit Cicero in Sestiana.” The
word ⁴ nitedula' is only found here and in
Arnobius adv. Nat. ii. c. 47, but the read-
ing ‘in cod. Arnobii' is ‘nitelula.’ But
‘ nitedula ’ is proved by the MSS. to be the
true reading and by the analogy of like
forms (Halm). Klotz says that he was
called Gracchus not on account of any re-
lationship to the family of the Gracchi, but
because he pretended to defend the people's
rights like the Gracchi3 as Orelli had ex-
plained it.

rem publicam . . . arrodere] The ⁴ ni-
tedula' nibbles at the Res Publica. I do
not know whether he means that he gets
at the money, as men do when they can, or
whether he says ‘ nibble at the Res Pub-
lica' without meaning any thing precise.

Abrami on the occasion quotes a passage
from Capitolinus' Life of Antoninus Pius:
‘⁶ Salaria multis subtraxit, quos otiosos vide-
bat accipere, dicens nihil esse sordidius
quam si rem publicam ii arroderent, qui nihil
in eam suo labore conferrent.’' The good
emperor was right, and has set us a good
example. What is more odious than a fel-
low who feeds on the state and does nothing
for it J

Serranus] ⁴ Not he of the plough,' the
man who left his tields to command the
armies of Rome, C. Atilius Calatinus con-
sul 13.c. 257 (Pro Rosc. Am. c. 18). Atilius
was called Serranus because he was found
sowing his land when he was summoned to
take command (Val. Max. iv. 4, 5).

“Quis Gracchi genus, aut geminos duo
fulmina belli
Scipiadas, cladem Libyae, parvoque po-
Fatbfrrittziiiiln, vel te sulco, Serrane‚ seren-
tem ?’' (Virg. Aen. vi. 843.)

Gavitolaelz'ore a calatis] Here is a cor-
ruption past cure. Cicero is making a play
on the word Calatinus. He says that the
man passed from ‘ Calati Gavii ’ to the ⁴ Ca-
latini Atilii 3' where the word ‘ Calati ' has
a reference probably to the ⁴ comitia calata,'
in which the adoptions of persons who were
⁴ sui juris ' were made. He says ‘ insitus,⁷
⁴ ingrafted.'

nominibus . . . sustulit] Abrami, says
Halm, has the merit of discovering the
meaning of this rather obscure passage. He
entered in his ‘tabulae,’ or book of accounts,
the sum which Clodius promised him for
his services, and then he erased his name
from the ‘ tabula' in which he had sub-
scribed it to the ‘promulgatio.’ Halm
translates it: ‘⁴ After he had entered in his
account-tables the sums which he had re-
ceived. all at once he struck out his name
