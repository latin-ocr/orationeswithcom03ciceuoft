460 ORAT. DE HARUSPIGUM RESPONSIS

optimatium, de quo ipso nunc monemur, ita perturbatum itaque
permutatum est, ut, quod frater consul ne fieret obstiterat, quod
affinis et sodalis, clarissimus vir, qui illum reum non laudarat,
excluserat, id is consul efficeret in discordiis principum, qui illi
unus inimicissimus esse debuerat, et eo fecisse auctore se diceret,
cujus auctoritatis neminem posset poenitere. Injecta est fax foeda
ac luctuosa rei publicae; petita est auctoritas vestra, gravitas am-
plissimorum ordinum, consensio bonorum omnium, totus denique
civitatis status. Haec enim certe petebantur, quum inme cogni-
torem harum omnium rerum illa flamma illorum temporum conji-
ciebatur. Excepi, et pro patria solus exarsi, sic tamen ut vos
iisdem ignibus circumsepti me primum ictum pro vobis et fumantem
videretis. XXII. Non sedabantur discordiae, sed etiam crescebat
in eos odium a quibus nos defendi putabamur. Ecce, iisdem

qui illi unus] “A hard censure for C.
Caesar ⁷' (Klotz). The Declamator means
C. Caesar no doubt.—‘ et eo fecissez' P. G. E.
and Baiter omit‘ et.’ This sentence ⁶ Quod
anno ' is· a fine specimen of the Declamator’s
style. It contains many choice things:
‘ Quod . . . excluserat . . . restiterat! Then,
‘id,’ which is the ¹ quod . . . excluserat . . .
restiterat,’ was ⁴ ita permutatum,' that ⁴ quod
frater . . . obstiterat, quod affinis excluse-
rat’ (which is the. id restored to its original
state after the ‘permutatio ’) ‘ id is consul
efficeret! A man could not write greater
nonsense than this ε “ Id Caesar perficeret,
qui tamen ei propter opertum Bonae Deae
vel maxime infensus esse debuisset, et qui,
quum perfecisset, excusandi sui causa Pom-
peio se auctore usum simulavit. Sic adop—
tione facta contra leges, injecta est fax rei
publicae etc.'’ (W⁷‹›lf).—‘eo auctore ι’ 110
means Cn. Pompeius, who had married
Caesar’s daughter Julia (13.0. 59).

eamr-Q] “ Arsi malebat Ernestius, quod
putabat, pro pam-ia ea'arslescere non satis
Latine construi. Illam elegantiam vix verbo
memorat, qua moxfumcms Consul tamquam
incensa domus describitur. Auctori, opi-
nor, compositum verbum efficacius videba-
tur, et apud Virgilium fortasse non satis
placebat ardens Ucaleyon, nisi etsumaret '’
(Wolf). It is no doubt very choice. This
writer is inexhaustible. It takes twice as
many words as he uses, and heis by no
means sparing in words, to draw out of him
all that is in him. A hint may help the
reader, and he may apply the same method
to many other beautiful passages which Ι
have passed over. First, a foul and sorrow-
bringing torch was hurled at the Res Pub-

lica3 the influence of the senate was the
object aimed at, and many other things,
‘ finally even the whole status of the state ;’
whatever that may mean. ‘These things
at least were the objects of attack,' when
that ‘flame of those times’ was hurled
against ‘me cognitorem harum omnium
rerum.' The ‘auctoritas vestra’ and other
things were the objects of the assault when
the flame was hurled against Cicero.
NVhether this ‘ flamma ’ is the famous ‘fax
foeda,' it is hard to say, or something else;
nor have Ι the least idea what he means
by ‘cognitorem harum omnium rerum!
He received the flamc (excepi), he rather
put himself in the way to meet it, for he
says ‘pro patria solus exarsi 3' from which
I conclude that the ‘ fax foeda ’ did not hit
the Res Publica, though aimed against it,
but Cicero put himself in the way. It is
true that this explanation involves an as-
sumption of the identity of the· ‘ Res Pub-
lica,' and the ‘ Patria ;' which Ι venture to
make, though with some hesitation, re-
membering what manner of writer Ι have to
explain. True he ⁴ blazed for his country,’
but with a limitation expressed by ‘sic
tamen ut,’ a form of expression which even
in a good author requires a very careful
translation. It means altogether: ‘⁴ Ι did
blaze for my country, and though I did, you
still were surrounded by the same fires, and
saw me first struck for you (Ι leave the
exact meaning uncertain) and smoking.’'

This ‘excepi ' is one of the Declamator’s
dai-ling bits ofrhetoric. He uses it often.
Compare De Domo, c. 24, “excepi meo
corpore,'’ διο. ; and c. 25, ‘⁴ omnem enim vim
. . . acerbitas mei casus exceperat.''
