potuisset. Hunc ego reditum repudiarem, qui ita florens fuit, ut
verear, ne qui me studio gloriae putet idcirco exisse ut ita redi-
rem? Quem enim umquam senatus civem nisi me nationibus
exteris commendavit-3 cujus umquam propter salutem nisi meam
senatus publice sociis populi Romani gratias egit? De me uno
patres conscripti decreverunt, ut, qui provincias cum imperio
obtinerent, qui quaestores legatique essent, salutem et vitam cus-
todirent. In una mea caussa post Romam conditam factum est,
ut litteris consularibus ex senatus consulto cuncta ex Italia omnes
qui rem publicam salvam vellent convocarentur. Quod numquam
senatus in universae rei publicae periculo decrevit, id in unius
mea salute conservanda decernendum putavit. Quem curia magis
requisivit? quem forum luxit? quem aeque ipsa tribunalia desi-
deraverunt? Omnia discessu meo deserta, horrida, muta, plena
luctus et maeroris fuerunt. Quis est Italiae locus in quo non
fixum sit in publicis monumentis studium salutis meae, testimonium
dignitatis?

LXI. Nam quid ego illa de me divina senatus consulta comme-
morem? vel quod in templo Jovis Optimi Maximi factum est,
quum vir, is qui tripertitas orbis terrarum oras atque regiones
tribus triumphis adjunctas huic imperio notavit, de scripto sen-

lilteris consularibus] The letter of P.
Lentulus only, c. 22. Halm says that XValter
(Hist. Jur. Rom. p. 135, ed. ii.) observes
that this letter was sent at that time, be-
cause in the harvest season it was not usual
for the country folks to attend the comitia,
especially those from the remoter parts of
Italy. How the country folks could come
to Rome from remote parts of Italy at any
season to attend the comitia is a thing that
passes my understanding. They would be
weeks on their journey and return, and
would spend the profits of a whole year.
The consul‘s letter might invite all Italy,
but all Italy would not and could not come.
This is said ⁴ oratorie,' falsely. In the next
chapter 116 speaks soherly ⁴¹ eorum qui ex
municipiis convenerant admonitu.¹' Many
of the richer people from the towns might
come, and that would be all.

qui tripertitas, &c.] Two of Cn. Poni-
peius’ triumphs are spoken of in the De
Imp. Cn. Pompeii, c. 26, and the notes,
Vol. II. His first triumph was for his
African victories, his second for his victo-
ries in Spain, and his third for his victory
over Mithridates in Asia (Plutarch, Pomp.
66. 14, 22, 45). The triumph over Mith-
ridates is described by Plutarch (c. 45), who
says : “ But it was the chief thing towards
his glory, and what had never happened
before to any Roman, that he celebrated his
third triumph over the third continent. For
though others before him had triumphed
three times, Pompeius by having gained his
first triumph over Libya, his second over
Europe, and this the last over Asia, seemed
in a manner to have brought the whole
world into his three triumphs.'’ We may
translate: “The man who marked three
separate extremes and divisions of the world
as added to our empire by his three tri-
umphs.'’
