370 ORAT. DE DOMO SUA

pecuniae, sacrorum secutae sunt. Tu neque Fonteius es, qui esse
debebas, neque patris heres, neque amissis sacris paternis in haec
adoptiva venisti. Ita perturbatis sacris, contaminatis gentibus, et
quam deseruisti et quam polluisti, jure Quiritium legitimo tutela-
rum et hereditatum relicto, factus es ejus filius contra fas, cujus
per aetatem pater esse potuisti. XIV. Dico apud pontifices:
nego istam adoptionem pontificio jure esse factam3 primum, quod
eae vestrae sint- aetates, ut is qui te adoptavit vel filii tibi loco per
aetatem esse potuerit, vel eo quo fuit3 deinde quod caussa quaeri
solet adoptandi, ut et is adoptet, qui quod natura jam assequi non
potest legitimo et pontificio jure quaerat, et ita adoptet, ut ne
quid aut de dignitate generum aut de sacrorum religione minuatum
illud in primis, ne qua calumnia, ne qua fraus, ne qui dolus

Tu neque Fonteius] If the adoption was
invalid, Clodius was not a Fonteius. We
can admit that3 but the writer is not satis-
fied with so little. He adds ‘ neque patris
heres.’ He was not the ‘heres ’ of his
natural father: the act of adoption, we are
told, had no effect except to make him not
the ‘heres ’ of his natural father. It is im-
possible to deal with a writer who does not
know what he is talking about. We may
allow him the expression ‘ patris heres.’ He
adds, “ you have lost your ‘ saera paterna,’
and have not come into the ‘ sacra adop-
tiva.' ” Clodius made an unlucky business
of it. . He got nothing and lost all. But
this is only by way of introduction to the
piece of bombast which follows. He ends
with saying that Clodius had become Fon-
teius’ son, only it was ‘ contra fas.’ ⁴ Factus
es ejus filius? Could the writer tell us
whether he means to say that Clodius did
become the son of Fonteius or not? And
if he diduot, because the adoption was illegal,
did he cease to be who he was? An illegal
adoption would have no effect. When Clo-
dius was adopted (adrogatus) he was ‘ sui
juris‚’ as the form of adoption implies. Be-
sides this, his father had long been dead.
It is true that he could be called the ‘heres’
of his father at any time after his father’s
death, and of course even now. But what
have we to do with Clodius being the ‘ heres '
of his father, when the only matter in ques-
tion was the ‘sacra‚' and that matter has
been mentioned once, and is mentioned
again (amissis sacris paternis) ?

14. velfiliz'] ‘ Loco patris vel filii,' Wolf
and others. ‘ Loco patris ’ are not in C. The
reader may wonder what ‘ vel eo quo fuit '
means. It is not worth the explanation.
It is worthy of the writer-3 and it is unfor-

tunately true, that it. is worthy of Cicer03
for he often says such things.

The rule that an older man could not
adopt a younger is stated in the Institutes
of Justinian (i. ll‚§ 43 Dig. l. 7. 15):
‘⁴ Minorem natu non posse majorem adop-
tare placet.'' Schrader (ed. lust.) remarks,
“that the law on this point was once
doubtful. Cicero finds fault with Clodius
being adopted by a younger man, and
says that it was not according to the Jus
Pontificium3 but Cicero himself admits
that the Pontifices approved of it. Com-
pare Suetou. Tiber. c. 2. Further it was
a doubtful mat-ter in the time of Gaius (i.
106) : ‘ Sed et illa quaestio, an minor natu
majorem adoptare possit.’ The word ⁴ pla-
cet’ also shows that there was a question
about the matter.'⁷—If the case of Clo-
dius had decided that it was not legal for a
‘minor' to adopt a ‘major‚' the doubt could
not have existed in the time of Gaius. The
passage in the Digest is from Ulpian‚ who
says that. a ‘minor' cannot adopt a ‘major.’
The Declamator's law and his facts are
equally bad.

leyite'mo . . . jure] Wolf doubts if ‘legi-
timum jus’ is ever used by other writers in
the sense of ‘jus civile’ or ‘jus publicum.y
Perhaps the writer’s ‘legitimum jus' be-
longs to the same branch of law as his ‘jus
rei publicae,’ both of which were unknown
to the Romans. ‘Legitimum jus’ would
mean the Law about Leges. Again, there
is ‘ simulata adoptio‚' where he is speaking
of adoption generally; which is nonsense.
Pantagathus read ‘ adeptio‚' and Baiter has
followed him. Wolf prefers ‘adeptio' to
any of the conjectures that have been made.
It seems to me a very inappropriate word.
